<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the year 1819, John Sargent, Rector of Lavington,
published <i>A Memoir of the Rev. Henry Martyn</i>. The
book at once became a spiritual classic. The saint, the
scholar, and the missionary, alike found in it a new
inspiration. It ran through ten editions during the writer&rsquo;s
life, and he died when projecting an additional volume of
the Journals and Letters. His son-in-law, S. Wilberforce,
afterwards Bishop of Oxford and of Winchester, accordingly,
in 1837 published, in two volumes, <i>Journals and Letters
of the Rev. Henry Martyn, B.D.</i>, with an introduction
on Sargent&rsquo;s life. Sargent had suppressed what Bishop
Wilberforce describes as &lsquo;a great variety of interesting
materials&rsquo;. Especially in the lifetime of Lydia Grenfell
it was thought necessary to omit the facts which give to
Henry Martyn&rsquo;s personality its human interest and intensify
our appreciation of his heroism. On the lady&rsquo;s
death, in 1829, Martyn&rsquo;s letters to her became available,
and Bishop Wilberforce incorporated these in what he described
as &lsquo;further and often more continuous selections from
the journals and letters of Mr. Martyn.&rsquo; But, unhappily,
his work does not fully supplement that of Sargent. The
<i>Journal</i> is still mutilated; the <i>Letters</i> are still imperfect.</p>

<p>Some years ago, on completing the <i>Life of William
Carey</i>, who had written that wherever his friend Henry
Martyn might go as chaplain the Church need not send a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
missionary, I began to prepare a new work on the first
modern apostle to the Mohammedans. I was encouraged
by his grand-nephew, a distinguished mathematician, the
late Henry Martyn Jeffery, F.R.S., who had in 1883 printed
<i>Two Sets of Unpublished Letters of the Rev. Henry Martyn,
B.D., of Truro</i>. For a time I stopped the work on learning
that he had come into possession of Lydia Grenfell&rsquo;s papers,
and was preparing the book which appeared in 1890,
<i>Extracts from the Religious Diary of Miss L. Grenfell, of
Marazion, Cornwall</i>. Except her letters to Henry Martyn,
which are not in existence now, all the desirable materials
seemed to be ready. Meanwhile, the missionary bishop
who most resembled Martyn in character and service,
Thomas Valpy French, of Lahore and Muscat, had written
to Canon Edmonds of S. Wilberforce&rsquo;s book as &lsquo;a work for
whose reprint I have often pleaded in vain, and for which
all that there is of mission life in our Church would plead,
had it not been so long out of print and out of sight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>My aim is to set the two autobiographies, unconsciously
written in the Journals and Letters of Henry Martyn and in
the Diary of Lydia Grenfell, in the light of recent knowledge
of South Africa and India, Persia and Turkey, and
of Bible work and missionary history in the lands of
which, by his life and by his death, Henry Martyn took
possession for the Master. Bengal chaplain of the East
India Company, he was, above all, a missionary to the
two divisions of Islam, in India and Persia, and in Arabia
and Turkey. May this book, written after years of experience
in Bengal, lead many to enter on the inheritance
he has left to the Catholic Church!</p>

Then came another of priestly garb and mien,<br />
A young man still wanting the years of Christ,<br />
But long since with the saints....<br />
A poet with the contemplative gaze<br />
And listening ear, but quick of force and eye,<br />
Who fought the wrong without, the wrong within,<br />
And, being a pure saint, like those of old,<br />
Abased himself and all the precious gifts<br />
God gave him, flinging all before the feet<br />
Of Him whose name he bore&mdash;a fragile form<br />
Upon whose hectic cheek there burned a flush<br />
That was not health; who lived as Xavier lived,<br />
And died like him upon the burning sands,<br />
Untended, yet whose creed was far from his<br />
As pole from pole; whom grateful England still<br />
Loves.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">The awakened gaze</span><br />
Turned wholly from the earth, on things of heaven<br />
He dwelt both day and night. The thought of God<br />
Filled him with infinite joy; his craving soul<br />
Dwelt on Him as a feast; as did the soul<br />
Of rapt Francesco in his holy cell<br />
In blest Assisi; and he knew the pain,<br />
The deep despondence of the saint, the doubt,<br />
The consciousness of dark offence, the joy<br />
Of full assurance last, when heaven itself<br />
Stands open to the ecstasy of faith.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">The relentless lie</span><br />
Of Islam ... he chose to bear, who knew<br />
How swift the night should fall on him, and burned<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>To save one soul alive while yet &rsquo;twas day.<br />
This filled his thoughts, this only, and for this<br />
On the pure altar of his soul he heaped<br />
A costlier sacrifice, this youth in years,<br />
For whom Love called, and loving hands, and hope<br />
Of childish lives around him, offering these,<br />
Like all the rest, to God.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">Yet when his hour</span><br />
Was come to leave his England, was it strange<br />
His weakling life pined for the parting kiss<br />
Of love and kindred, whom his prescient soul<br />
Knew he should see no more?<br />
<br />
... The woman of his love<br />
Feared to leave all and give her life to his,<br />
And both to God; his sisters passed away<br />
To heaven, nor saw him more. There seemed on earth<br />
Nothing for which to live, except the Faith,<br />
Only the Faith, the Faith! until his soul<br />
Wore thin her prison bars, and he was fain<br />
To rest awhile, or work no more the work<br />
For which alone he lived.<br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="subheading">CORNWALL AND CAMBRIDGE, 1781-1803</p>


<p>Writing half a century ago, as one who gratefully
accepted the guidance of the Church of England, from
the evangelical and philanthropic side of which he sprang,
Sir James Stephen declared the name of Henry Martyn
to be &lsquo;in fact the one heroic name which adorns her
annals from the days of Elizabeth to our own&rsquo;. The
past fifty years have seen her annals, in common with those
of other Churches, adorned by many heroic names. These
are as many and as illustrious on the side which has
enshrined Henry Martyn in the new Cathedral of Truro,
as amongst the Evangelicals, to whom in life he belonged.
But the influence which streams forth from his short life
and his obscure death is the perpetual heritage of all English-speaking
Christendom, and of the native churches of India,
Arabia, Persia, and Anatolia in all time to come. His
<i>Journal</i>, even in the mutilated form published first by his
friend Sargent, is one of the great spiritual autobiographies
of Catholic literature. It is placed beside the <i>Confessions</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of Augustine and the <i>Grace Abounding</i> of Bunyan. The
<i>Letters</i> are read along with those of Samuel Rutherford and
William Cowper by the most saintly workers, persuasive
preachers, and learned scholars, who, even in these days
of searching criticism, attribute to the young chaplain-missionary
their early inspiration and renewed consecration,
even as he traced his to Brainerd, Carey, and Charles Simeon.</p>

<p>Born in Truro on February 18, 1781, Henry Martyn
came from a land the oldest and most isolated in Great
Britain; a Celtic people but recently transformed from the
rudest to the most courteous and upright; a family created
and partly enriched by the great mining industry; and
a church which had been the first, in these far-western
islands, to receive the teaching of the Apostles of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>The tin found in the lodes and streams of the
Devonian Slates of West Cornwall was the only large
source of supply to the world down to Henry Martyn&rsquo;s
time. The granite porphyries which form the Land&rsquo;s End
had come to be worked only a century before that for the
&lsquo;bunches&rsquo; of copper which fill the lines of fault and fissure.
It was chiefly from the deeper lodes of Gwennap, near
Truro, that his family had drawn a competence. The
statement of Richard Carew, in his <i>Survey of Cornwall</i>,
was true of the dim centuries before Herodotus wrote, that
the &lsquo;tynne of the little angle (Cornwall) overfloweth
England, watereth Christendom, and is derived to a great
part of the world besides&rsquo;.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Tyrian and Jew, Greek and
Roman, as navigators, travellers, and capitalists, had in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
darkness of prehistoric days dealings with the land described
in an Elizabethan treatise on Geography as a foreign
country on that side of England next to Spain. London
itself is modern compared with the Cornish trade, which in
its latest stage assumed the Latin name <i>Stannum</i>, and the
almost perfect economic laws administered by the Lord
Warden of the Stannaries since King John leased the mines
to the Jews, and Edward I., as Earl of Cornwall, established
the now vexed &lsquo;royalties&rsquo; by charter. Even in the century
since Henry Martyn&rsquo;s early days, fourteen of the Cornish
mines have yielded a gross return of more than thirteen
millions sterling, of which above one-fifth was clear profit.</p>

<p>Whether the Romans used the Britons in the mines as
slaves or not, the just and democratic system of working
them&mdash;which was probably due to the Norman kings, and
extorted the admiration of M. Jars, a French traveller of
the generation to which Henry Martyn&rsquo;s father belonged&mdash;did
not humanise the population. So rude were their manners
that their heath-covered rocks bore the name of &lsquo;West
Barbary.&rsquo; Writing two centuries before Martyn, Norden
described the city of his birth as remarkable for its neatness,
which it still is, but he added, there is not a town &lsquo;more
discommendable for the pride of the people.&rsquo; The Cornish
miner&rsquo;s life is still as short as it is hard and daring, in spite
of his splendid physique and the remarkable health of the
women and children. But the perils of a rock-bound
coast, the pursuits of wrecking and smuggling, added to
the dangers of the mines, and all isolated from the growing
civilisation of England, had combined, century after century,
to make Cornwall a byword till John Wesley and George
Whitfield visited it. Then the miner became so changed,
not less really because rapidly, that the feature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
whole people which first and most continuously strikes a
stranger is their grave and yet hearty politeness. Thomas
Carlyle has, in his <i>Life of Sterling</i>, pictured the moral
heroism which Methodism, with its &lsquo;faith of assurance,&rsquo;
developes in the ignorant Cornish miner, a faith which,
as illustrated by William Carey and taught by the Church
of England, did much to make Henry Martyn what he
became. John Wesley&rsquo;s own description in the year of
Henry Martyn&rsquo;s birth is this: &lsquo;It pleased God the seed
there sown has produced an abundant harvest. Indeed, I
hardly know any part of the three kingdoms where there
has been a more general change.&rsquo; The Cornishman still
beguiles the weary hours of his descent of the ladder to
his toil by crooning the hymns of Charles Wesley.
The local preacher whose eloquent earnestness and
knowledge of his Bible have delighted the stranger on
Sunday, is found next day two hundred fathoms below
the sea, doing his eight hours&rsquo; work all wet and grimy and
red from the iron-sand, picking out the tin of Bottallack or
the copper of Gwennap. Long before Henry Martyn knew
Simeon he had become unconsciously in some sense the
fruit of the teaching of the Wesleys.</p>

<p>During fifty-five years again and again John Wesley
visited Cornwall, preaching in the open air all over the
mining county and in the fishing hamlets, till two generations
were permanently changed. His favourite centre
was Gwennap, which had long been the home of the
Martyn family, a few miles from Truro. There he found
his open-air pulpit and church in the great hollow, ever
since known as &lsquo;Wesley&rsquo;s Pit,&rsquo; where, to this day, thousands
crowd every Whit-Monday to commemorative services.
Wesley&rsquo;s published journal, which closes with October 1790,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
when Henry Martyn was nearly ten years of age, has
more frequent and always more appreciative references to
Gwennap than to any other town. On July 6, 1745, we
find him writing:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At Gwennap also we found the people in the utmost
consternation. Word was brought that a great company
of tinners, made drunk on purpose, were coming to do
terrible things&mdash;so that abundance of people went away.
I preached to the rest on &lsquo;Love your enemies.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>By 1774 we read &lsquo;the glorious congregation was
assembled at five in the amphitheatre at Gwennap.&rsquo; Next
year we find this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;At five in the evening in the amphitheatre at Gwennap.
I think this is the most magnificent spectacle which is to
be seen on this side heaven. And no music is to be
heard upon earth comparable to the sound of many thousand
voices when they are all harmoniously joined together
singing &ldquo;praises to God and the Lamb.&rdquo; Four-and-twenty
thousand were present, frequently, at that spot. And
yet all, I was informed, could hear distinctly in the fair,
calm evening.&rsquo; Again: &lsquo;I think this is my <i>ne plus ultra</i>.
I shall scarce see a larger congregation till we meet in the
air.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>We are thus introduced to the very spot where Henry
Martyn was born: &lsquo;About noon I preached in the piazza
adjoining to the Coinage Hall in Truro. I was enabled to
speak exceeding plain on &ldquo;Ye are saved through faith.&rdquo;&rsquo;
In the evening of the same day Wesley preached in the
fishing village of Megavissey, &lsquo;where I saw a very rare
thing&mdash;men swiftly increasing in substance, and yet not
decreasing in holiness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>From such a land and such influences sprang the first
missionary hero of the Church of England in modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
times. The Martyn family had for more than a century
been known locally as one of skilled miners, described by
their ablest representative in recent times<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as &lsquo;mine agents
or mine captains who filled positions of trust.&rsquo; Martin
Luther had a similar origin. There is no evidence that
any of them went underground, although that, if true,
would justify the romance for which Martyn&rsquo;s first biographer
is responsible. His great-grandfather was Thomas
Martyn, his grandfather was John Martyn of Gwennap
Churchtown, and his grand-uncle was the surveyor, Thomas
Martyn (1695-1751), who published the map of Cornwall
described as a marvel of minute and accurate topography,
due to a survey on foot for fifteen years. Mr. Jeffery
quotes from some manuscript notes written by his father:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>John, an elder brother of Thomas Martyn, was the
father of John Martyn, who was born at Gwennap Churchtown,
and, when young, was put as an accountant at Wheal
Virgin Mine. He was soon made cashier to Ralph Allen
Daniell, Esq., of Trelissick. Mr. Martyn held one-twenty-fourth
of Wheal Unity Mine, where upwards of 300,000<i>l.</i>
was divided. He then resided in a house opposite the
Coinage Hall (now the Cornish Bank), Truro, a little below
the present Market House. Here Henry Martyn was born
February 18, 1781, and was sent thence to Dr. Cardew&rsquo;s
School in 1788.</p></div>

<p>The new Town Hall stands on the site of the house.</p>

<p>The boy bore a family name which is common in Southwest
England, and which was doubtless derived, in the first
instance, from the great missionary monk of Celtic France,
the founder of the Gallic Church, St. Martin, Bishop of
Tours. Born in what is now Lower Hungary, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a pagan soldier of Rome, St. Martin, during his long life
which nearly covered the fourth century, made an impression,
especially on Western or Celtic Christendom, even
greater than that of the Devonshire Winfrith or Boniface
on Germany long after him. It was in the generation
after his death, when St. Martin&rsquo;s glory was at its height,
that the Saxon invasion of Britain led to the migration of
British Christians from West and South England to
Armorica, which was thence called Brittany. The intercourse
between Cornwall and Britannia Minor became as
close as is now the case between the Celtic districts of the
United Kingdom and North America. Missionaries continually
passed and repassed between them. St. Corentin,
consecrated Bishop of Quimper in Brittany or French
Cornwall, by the hands of St. Martin himself, was sent to
Cornwall long before Pope Gregory despatched St. Augustin
to Canterbury, and became a popular Cornish saint after
whom St. Cury&rsquo;s parish is still named. On the other side,
the Early British Church of Cornwall, where we still find
Roman Christian inscriptions, kept up a close fellowship
with the Church in Ireland. The earliest martyrs and
hermits of the Church of Cornu-Gallia were companions of
St. Patrick.</p>

<p>Certainly there is no missionary saint in all the history
of the Church of Christ whom, in his character, Henry
Martyn so closely resembled as his namesake, the apostle
of the Gallic peoples. In the pages of the bishop&rsquo;s biographer,
Sulpicius Severus, we see the same self-consecration
which has made the <i>Journal</i> of Henry Martyn a
stimulus to the noblest spirits of modern Christendom;
the same fiery zeal, often so excessive as to defeat the
Divine mission; the same soldier-like obedience and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
humility; the same prayerfulness without ceasing, and
faith in the power of prayer; the same fearlessness in
preaching truth however disagreeable to the luxurious and
vicious of the time; and, above all on the practical side,
the same winning loveableness and self-sacrifice for others
which have made the story of St. Martin dividing his cloak
with the beggar second only, in Mediæval art, to the Gospel
records of the Lord&rsquo;s own acts of tender grace and Divine
self-emptying. As we trace, step by step, the unceasing
service of Henry Martyn to men for love of his Master,
we shall find a succession of modern parallels to the act of
St. Martin, who, when a lad of eighteen with his regiment
at Amiens, himself moneyless, answered the appeal of a
beggar, shivering at the city gates in a cruel winter, by
drawing his dagger, dividing his military cloak, and giving
half of it to the naked man. If the legend continues to
run, that the boy saw in a dream Christ Himself in the
half-cloak saying to the attendant angels, &lsquo;Martin, still a
catechumen, has clothed Me with this garment,&rsquo; and forthwith
sought baptism&mdash;that is only a form of the same spirit
which, from the days of Paul to our own, finds inspiration
in the thought that we are compassed about by a great
cloud of witnesses.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn was baptised in the old church of St.
Mary, now part of the unfinished cathedral. He was the
third of four children. The eldest, a half-brother, John,
was born fifteen years before him. The second and fourth
were his own sisters, Laura and Sally; the former married
Mr. Curgenven, nephew of the Vicar of Lamorran of that
name; the latter married a Mr. Pearson. Short-lived as
Henry himself proved to be, all three died before him.
To both the sisters&mdash;and especially to the younger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
who proved to be to him at once sister, mother, and
spiritual guide to Christ&mdash;there are frequent allusions in his
<i>Journals and Letters</i>. His mother, named Fleming, and
from Ilfracombe, died in the year after his birth, having
transmitted her delicate constitution to her children. It
was through his father, as well as younger sister, that the
higher influences were rained on Henry Martyn. In the
wayward and often wilful years before the boy yielded to
the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the father&rsquo;s gentleness
kept him in the right way, from which any violent opposition
would have driven one of proud spirit. A skilled
accountant and practical self-trained mathematician, the
father encouraged in the boy the study of science, and
early introduced him to the great work of Newton. Valuing
the higher education as few in England did at that
time, John Martyn ever kept before the lad the prospect
of a University course. Looking back on these days, and
especially on his last visit home before his father&rsquo;s unexpected
death, Henry Martyn wrote when he was eighteen
years of age:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The consummate selfishness and exquisite irritability
of my mind were displayed in rage, malice, and envy, in
pride and vain-glory and contempt of all; in the harshest
language to my sister, and even to my father, if he happened
to differ from my mind and will. Oh, what an
example of patience and mildness was he! I love to
think of his excellent qualities, and it is frequently the
anguish of my heart that I ever could be so base and
wicked as to pain him by the slightest neglect.</p></div>

<p>Truro was fortunate in its grammar school&mdash;&lsquo;the Eton
of Cornwall&rsquo;&mdash;and in the headmaster of that time, the Rev.
Cornelius Cardew, D.D., whose portrait now adorns the cit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>y&rsquo;s
council chamber. The visitor who seeks out the old school
in Boscawen Street now finds it converted into the ware-room
of an ironmonger. All around may still be seen the
oak panels on which successive generations of schoolboys cut
their names. A pane of glass on which Henry Martyn
scratched his name, with a Greek quotation and a Hebrew
word, probably on his last visit to the spot before he left
England for ever, is reverently preserved in the muniment
room of the corporation buildings. There also are the
musty folios of the dull history and duller divinity which
formed the school library of that uncritical century, but
there is no means of tracing the reading of the boys. Into
this once lightsome room, adorned only by a wood-carving
of the galleon which formed the city arms, was the child
Henry Martyn introduced at the age of seven. Dr. Clement
Carlyon, who was one of his fellow-pupils, writes of him as
&lsquo;a good-humoured plain little fellow, with red eyelids devoid
of eyelashes&rsquo;. But we know from Mrs. Sherwood, when she
first met him in India&mdash;where his hair, a light brown, was
raised from his forehead, which was a remarkably fine one&mdash;that
although his features were not regular, &lsquo;the expression
was so luminous, so intellectual, so affectionate, so beaming
with Divine charity, as to absorb the attention of every
observer&rsquo;. His sensitive nature and violent passionateness
when roused, at once marked him out as the victim of the
older boys. In a happy moment Dr. Cardew put &lsquo;little
Henry Martyn&rsquo; under the care of one of them, who became
his protector, tutor, and friend, not only at school but at
college, and had an influence on his spiritual as well as intellectual
life next only to that of his father, sister, and
Charles Simeon. That &lsquo;upper boy&rsquo;&mdash;named Kempthorne,
son of Admiral Kempthorne, of Helston&mdash;delighted to recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to his first biographer, Sargent, &lsquo;the position in which he used
to sit, the thankful expression of his affectionate countenance,
when he happened to be helped out of some difficulty, and
a thousand other little incidents of his boyish days.&rsquo; This
boy-friend &lsquo;had often the happiness of rescuing him from
the grasp of oppressors, and has never seen more feeling
of gratitude evinced than was shown by him on those
occasions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Even at seven Henry&rsquo;s natural cleverness was so
apparent that high expectations of his future were formed.
Dr. Cardew wrote of his proficiency in the classics as exceeding
that of most of his school-fellows, but he was too
lively and too careless to apply himself as some did who
distanced him. &lsquo;He was of a lively, cheerful temper, and,
as I have been told by those who sat near him, appeared to
be the idlest among them, being frequently known to go
up to his lesson with little or no preparation, as if he had
learnt it by intuition.&rsquo; The delicacy of his constitution
naturally kept him from joining in the rougher games of
his fellows. Such was the impression made by his progress
at school that, when he was fifteen years of age, not only
Dr. Cardew and his father, but many of his father&rsquo;s friends,
urged him to compete for a vacant scholarship of Corpus
Christi College, Oxford. With only a letter to the sub-rector
of Exeter College, the usual Cornish College, the
boy found himself in the great University city. The examiners
were divided in opinion as to the result, but a
majority gave it in favour of one with whom Henry Martyn
was almost equal. Had he become a member of that
University at fifteen, with character unformed and knowledge
immature or superficial, it is not likely that Oxford
would have gained what, at a riper stage, Cambridge fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
heir to. His own comment, written afterwards like Augustine&rsquo;s
in the <i>Confessions</i>, was this: &lsquo;The profligate acquaintances
I had in Oxford would have introduced me to
scenes of debauchery, in which I must, in all probability,
from my extreme youth, have sunk for ever.&rsquo; He returned
to school for two years, to extend his knowledge of the
classics. He spent his leisure in shooting, and in reading
travels and Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>. His early private
Journal reflects severely on that time as spent in &lsquo;attributing
to a want of taste for mathematics what ought to have
been ascribed to idleness; and having his mind in a roving,
dissatisfied, restless condition, seeking his chief pleasure in
reading and human praise.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="caption">ST. JOHN&rsquo;S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, IN 1797</span>
</div>

<p>In this spirit he began residence in St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, in the month of October 1797, as a pensioner
or unassisted student. To that University he was
attracted by Kempthorne, who had been his protector
at school, and had just distinguished himself at St.
John&rsquo;s, coming out Senior Wrangler. Alike from the
idleness to which he was tempted by other fellow-students
who were new to him, and from the variety of study
with no other motive than to win glory of men, his
friend gradually weaned his fickle and impulsive genius.
But for two years he halted between two opinions. He
was ever restless because ever dissatisfied with himself,
and his want of inward peace only increased the natural
irritability of his temper. He indulged in bursts of passion
on slight provocation, and sometimes on none at all, save
that of an uneasy conscience. Like Clive about the same
age, Henry Martyn on one occasion hurled a knife at his
friend, Cotterill, who just escaped, leaving it quivering in the
panel of the dining-hall. The father and younger sister at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>home prayerfully watched over him, and by letter sought to
guide him. On his periodical visits to Truro he was able
at least to report success in his examinations, and at the
close of 1799 he came out first, to his father&rsquo;s delight.
The providence of God had made all things ready for the
completion of His eighteen years&rsquo; work in the convictions
and character of Henry Martyn, on his return to college.
To him, at the opening of the new century, all things
became new.</p>

<p>Cambridge, first of all, had received&mdash;unconsciously to
its leading men for a time&mdash;that new spirit which has ever
since identified its University with the aggressive missionary
philanthropy of the nineteenth century. For nearly the
whole period of Martyn&rsquo;s life, up to that time, Charles
Simeon, the Eton boy, Fellow of King&rsquo;s College, and
Christian gentleman, who had sought the position only
that he might preach Christ after the manner of St. Paul,
had, from the pulpit of Trinity Church, been silently transforming
academic life. He had become the trusted agent
of Charles Grant and George Udny, the Bengal civilians
who were ready to establish an eight-fold mission in
Bengal as soon as he could send out the men. Failing to
find these, he had brought about the foundation of the
Church Missionary Society on April 12, 1799. Some
years before that, Charles Grant exchanged his seat in the
Bengal council for one of the &lsquo;chairs&rsquo; of the Court of
Directors. He became their chairman, and it was to Simeon
that he turned for East India chaplains. Cambridge, even
more than London itself, had become the centre of the
spiritual life of the Church of England.</p>

<p>First among the fellow-students of Henry Martyn,
though soon to leave for India when he entered it, was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
future friend, Claudius Buchanan, B.A. of 1796 and Fellow
of Queen&rsquo;s College, of which Isaac Milner was president.
Magdalene College&mdash;which had sent David Brown to Calcutta
in 1786, to prepare the way for the other four, who
are for ever memorable as &lsquo;the Five Chaplains&rsquo;&mdash;had among
its students of the same standing as Martyn, Charles
Grant&rsquo;s two distinguished sons, of whom one became Lord
Glenelg and a cabinet minister, and the younger, Robert,
was afterwards Governor of Bombay, the still valued
hymnologist, and the warm friend of Dr. John Wilson.
Thomason&mdash;seven years older than Martyn, and induced
afterwards, by his example, to become a Bengal chaplain&mdash;was
Simeon&rsquo;s curate and substitute in the closing years of
the last century, when to Mr. Thornton of Clapham, who
had warned him against preaching five sermons a week, as
casting the net too often to allow time to mend it, he drew
this picture of college life: &lsquo;There are reasons for fearing
the mathematical religion which so prevails here. Here,
also, is everything that can contribute to the ease and
comfort of life. Whatever pampers the appetite and
administers fuel to sloth and indolence is to be found in
abundance. Nothing is left to want or desire. Here is
the danger; this is the horrible precipice.&rsquo; Corrie and
Dealtry, also of the Five Chaplains, and afterwards first
and second Bishops of Madras, were of Martyn&rsquo;s Cambridge
time, the latter graduating before, and the former
just after him.</p>

<p>Hardly had Henry Martyn returned to college in
January 1800 when he received from his half-brother news
of the death of their father, whom he had just before left
&lsquo;in great health and spirits.&rsquo; The first result was &lsquo;consternation,&rsquo;
and then, as he told his sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was extremely low-spirited, and, like most people,
began to consider seriously, without any particular determination,
that invisible world to which he had gone and
to which I must one day go. As I had no taste at this time
for my usual studies, I took up my Bible. Nevertheless I
often took up other books to engage my attention, and
should have continued to do so had not Kempthorne
advised me to make this time an occasion of serious
reflection. I began with the Acts, as being the most
amusing, and when I was entertained with the narrative I
found myself insensibly led to inquire more attentively into
the doctrines of the Apostles.... On the first night after,
I began to pray from a precomposed form, in which I
thanked God in general for having sent Christ into the
world. But though I prayed for pardon I had little sense
of my own sinfulness; nevertheless, I began to consider
myself a religious man.</p></div>

<p>The college chapel service at once had a new meaning
for the student whom death had shaken and the Book of
the Acts of the Apostles had awakened. &lsquo;The first time
after this that I went to chapel I saw, with some degree of
surprise at my former inattention, that in the Magnificat
there was a great degree of joy expressed at the coming of
Christ, which I thought but reasonable.&rsquo; His friend then
lent him Doddridge&rsquo;s <i>Rise and Progress of Religion in the
Soul</i>, but, because the first part of that book &lsquo;appeared to
make religion consist too much in humiliation, and my
proud and wicked heart would not bear to be brought down
into the dust,&rsquo; he could not bear to read it. &lsquo;Soon, however,&rsquo;
as he afterwards told his sister, who had prayed for this
very thing all her life, as Monica had agonised for Augustine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
&lsquo;I began to attend more diligently to the words of our
Saviour in the New Testament, and to devour them with
delight. When the offers of mercy and forgiveness were
made so freely, I supplicated to be made partaker of the
covenant of grace with eagerness and hope, and thanks be
to the ever-blessed Trinity for not leaving me without
comfort.&rsquo; The doctrines of the Apostles, based on the
narrative of the Acts, and confirming the teaching of the
family in early youth, were seen to be in accord with the
words of the Master, and thus Henry Martyn started on
the Christian life an evangelical of the Evangelicals. In
the preaching and the personal friendship of the minister
of Trinity Church he found sympathetic guidance, and so
&lsquo;gradually acquired more knowledge in divine things.&rsquo; All
the hitherto irregular impulses of his fervent Celtic nature
received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and became
centred in the living, reigning, personal Christ. All the
restless longings of his soul and his senses found their
satisfaction for ever in the service of Him who had said
&lsquo;He that loveth his life shall lose it. If any man serve Me,
let him follow Me, and where I am there shall also My
servant be.&rsquo; All the pride of his genius, his intellectual ambition,
and his love of praise became purged by the determination
thenceforth to know nothing save the Crucified One.</p>

<p>His first temptation and test of honest fitness for such
service was found in the examination for degrees, and
especially for the greatest honour of all, that of Senior
Wrangler. If we place his conversion to Christ at the
close of his nineteenth year, we find that the whole of his
twentieth was spent in the necessary preparation for the
competition, and in the accompanying spiritual struggles.
It is not surprising that, when looking back on that year
from higher experiences, he should be severe in his self-examination.
But the path of duty clearly lay in hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and constant study, and not alone in religious meditation.
It was not surprising that the experienced convert should
afterwards pronounce the former worldly, and lament that
&lsquo;the intenseness with which I pursued my studies&rsquo; prevented
his growth in contrition, and in a knowledge of the excellency
of Christ. But so severe a judge as his friend and
fellow-student John Sargent, who knew all the facts, and
became not less saintly than himself, declares that there
was no reason, save his own humility, for his suspecting
a want of vitality at least in his spiritual life in this
critical year. His new-found life in Christ, and delight in
the Bible, reacted on his whole nature, elevating it to that
degree of spontaneous energy free from all self-consciousness
which is the surest condition, divine and human, of success.
He himself used to tell how, when he entered the Senate
House, the text of a sermon he had recently heard quieted
his spirit: &lsquo;Seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek
them not, saith the Lord.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Henry Martyn was not fully twenty years of age when,
in January 1801, he came out Senior Wrangler and first
Smith&rsquo;s (mathematical) Prizeman. His year was one of
the most brilliant in the recent history of the University.
Woodall of Pembroke was second. Robert Grant was
third, and Charles Grant (Lord Glenelg) fourth Wrangler.
They distanced him in classics, once his strongest point.
But the boy who entered college believing that geometry
was to be learned by committing Euclid<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to memory had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
given the whole strength of his powers during three
years to the college examinations, so as to please his
father and win the applause of his fellows. Until recently
it was possible for a student to enter the University ignorant
of mathematics, and to come out Senior Wrangler,
as the late Professor Kelland used to tell his Edinburgh
class. Such was the reverence for Newton that the
Leibnizian methods were not recognised in the University
studies till the reform of the Cambridge course was introduced
by Dean Peacock and his contemporaries. In
those earlier days, Dr. Carlyon,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who had been one of his
school-fellows, tells us high Wranglers won their places by
correct book-work rapidly produced in oral examination
from four set treatises by Wood and Vince, on optics,
mechanics, hydrostatics, and astronomy; problem papers
were answered by the best men. Martyn&rsquo;s grand-nephew,
himself a distinguished mathematician, remarks that he
sprang from a family of calculators, and so had the patience
and taste necessary for mathematical attainments. There
is no evidence that he pursued science even at Cambridge
except as a tutor; he does not appear to have been a
mathematical examiner even in his own college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p><p>The truth is seen in his own comment on a success
which at once won for him admiration and deference in
circles that could not appreciate the lofty Christian aims of
his life: &lsquo;I obtained my highest wishes, but was surprised to
find that I had grasped a shadow.&rsquo; He was called to other
service, and for that he brought his University triumph
with him to the feet of Christ. He was too cultured,
however, to despise learning or academic reputation,
for they might be made weapons for the Master&rsquo;s use,
and we shall find him wielding both alike in home
and foreign missions. His genius and learning found
expression in the study, the translation, and the unceasing
application to the consciences of men, of the Word of God.
His early love of the classics of Greece and Rome prevailed
over his later mathematical studies to make him an ardent
philologist, with the promise, had he lived, of becoming an
Orientalist of the type of Sir William Jones. If he was
known in his college as &lsquo;the man who had not lost an
hour&rsquo; when University honours alone were his object, how
much would not his unresting perseverance have accomplished,
when directed by the highest of all motives, had
he been spared to the age of William Carey or John
Wilson?</p>

<p>The time had come for the brilliant student to decide
on his profession. The same ambition which had stimulated
him to his college successes, had led him to resolve on
studying the law, as the most lucrative. &lsquo;I could not consent
to be poor for Christ&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; was his own language at
a later period. But Christ himself had changed all that, as
effectually as when the young lawyer Saul was stricken
down after the martyr testimony of Stephen. The year
1801 was to him one of comparative solitude, both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Cornwall and at the University, where he cultivated the
fruitful grace of meditation, learning to know and to master
himself, as he came to know more and more intimately,
and to submit himself to, Christ Jesus. He was admitted
to the inner circle of Simeon&rsquo;s friends, and to unreserved
intercourse with men of his own age who had come to
Christ before him. Especially was he drawn to John
Sargent, one year his senior, who was about to leave the
university for the Temple, that he might by the study of
law prepare himself to administer worthily the family estate
to which he was to succeed. His son-in-law, the late
Bishop S. Wilberforce, has left us a charming picture<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of
this saintly man, of whom Martyn wrote, even at college,
&lsquo;Sargent seems to be outstripping us all.&rsquo; While Simeon
ever, by his counsels and his example, impressed on the
choice youth whom he gathered around him the attractiveness
of the Christian ministry,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Sargent bewailed that only a
painful sense of duty to others kept him from it, and in a
few years he succeeded in entering its consecrated ranks.
Among such friends, and with his own heart growing in
the experience of the power of the Holy Spirit, Henry
Martyn was constrained, notwithstanding his new humbleness
of mind, to hear and obey the divine call. He
who had received such mercy must tell it abroad; he who
had known such love must bring others to share the
sweetness. Hence he writes to his sister:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When we consider the misery and darkness of the
unregenerate world, oh! with how much reason shall we
burst out into thanksgiving to God, who has called us in
His mercy through Christ Jesus! What are we, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
should thus be made objects of distinguishing grace!
Who, then, that reflects upon the rock from which he was
hewn, but must rejoice to give himself entirely and without
reserve to God, to be sanctified by His Spirit. The
soul that has truly experienced the love of God, will not stay
meanly inquiring how much he shall do, and thus limit his
service, but will be earnestly seeking more and more to
know the will of our Heavenly Father, and that he may be
enabled to do it. Oh, may we both be thus minded! may
we experience Christ to be our all in all, not only as our
Redeemer, but also as the fountain of grace. Those
passages of the Word of God which you have quoted on
this head, are indeed awakening; may they teach us to
breathe after holiness, to be more and more dead to the
world, and alive unto God, through Jesus Christ. We are
as lights in the world; how needful then that our tempers
and lives should manifest our high and heavenly calling!
Let us, as we do, provoke one another to good works, not
doubting that God will bless our feeble endeavours to His
glory.</p></div>

<p>The next year, 1802, saw Martyn Fellow of his College
and the winner of the first University prize for a Latin
essay, open to those who had just taken the Bachelor of
Arts degree. It ended in his determination to offer himself
to the Church Missionary Society. He had no sooner
resolved to be a minister of Christ than he began such
home mission work as lay to his hands among his fellow
members of the University, and in the city where, at a
recent period, one who closely resembled him in some
points, Ion Keith-Falconer, laboured. When ministering
to a dying man he found that the daughters had removed
to another house, where they were cheerful, and one of the
students was reading a play to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> &lsquo;A play! when their
father was lying in the agonies of death! What a species
of consolation! I rebuked him so sharply, and, I am
afraid, so intemperately, that a quarrel will perhaps ensue.&rsquo;
This is the first of those cases in which the impulsively
faithful Christian, testifying for his Master, often roused
hatred to himself. But the student afterwards thanked him
for his words, became a new man, and went out to India,
where he laboured for a time by his side. After a summer
tour&mdash;during which he walked to Liverpool, and then
through Wales, ascending Snowdon&mdash;Henry Martyn found
himself in the old home in Truro, then occupied by his
brother. From the noise of a large family he moved to
Woodbury: &lsquo;With my brother-in-law<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I passed some of
the sweetest moments in my life. The deep solitude of
the place favoured meditation; and the romantic scenery
around supplied great external sources of pleasure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Along the beautiful coast of Cornwall and Devon there
is no spot more beautiful than Woodbury. It is henceforth
sacred as Moulton in Carey&rsquo;s life, and St. Andrews in
Alexander Duff&rsquo;s, for there Henry Martyn wrestled out
his deliberate dedication to the service of Christ in India
and Persia. The Fal river is there just beginning to open
out into the lovely estuary which, down almost to Falmouth
town and Carrick Road, between Pendennis and St. Mawes,
is clothed on either side with umbrageous woods. On the
left shore, after leaving the point from which is the best
view of Truro and its cathedral, now known as the Queen&rsquo;s
View, there is Malpas, and further on are the sylvan glories
of Tregothnan. On the right shore, sloping down to the
ever-moving tide, are the oaks, ilexes, and firs which inclose
Woodbury, recently rebuilt. There the Cambridge scholar
of twenty-one roamed and read his Bible (especially Isaiah);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
&lsquo;and from this I derived great spirituality of mind compared
with what I had known before.&rsquo; He returned to
Cambridge and its tutorial duties, ready to become Simeon&rsquo;s
curate, and ultimately to go abroad when the definite call
should come. In the first conversation which he had with
him, Simeon, who had been reading the last number of
the <i>Periodical Accounts</i> from Serampore, drew attention to
the results of William Carey&rsquo;s work, in the first nine years
of his pioneering, as showing what a single missionary
could accomplish. From this time, in his letters and
journals, we find all his thoughts and reading, when alone,
revolving around the call to the East.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1803, January 12</i> to <i>19</i>.&mdash;Reading Lowth on Isaiah&mdash;Acts&mdash;and
abridged Bishop Hopkins&rsquo; first sermon on
Regeneration. On the 19th called on Simeon, from whom
I found that I was to go to the East Indies, not as a
missionary, but in some superior capacity; to be stationed
at Calcutta, or possibly at Ceylon. This prospect of this
world&rsquo;s happiness gave me rather pain than pleasure, which
convinced me that I had before been running away from
the world, rather than overcoming it. During the whole
course of the day, I was more worldly than for some time
past, unsettled and dissatisfied. In conversation, therefore,
I found great levity, pride, and bitterness. What a sink
of corruption is this heart, and yet I can go on from day
to day in self-seeking and self-pleasing! Lord, shew me
myself, nothing but &lsquo;wounds and bruises, and putrefying
sores,&rsquo; and teach me to live by faith on Christ my all.</p>

St. John&rsquo;s, January 17, 1803.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear Sargent,&mdash;G. and H. seem to disapprove
of my project much; and on this account I have been
rather discouraged of late, though not in any degree convinced.
It would be more satisfactory to go out with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
full approbation of my friends, but it is in vain to attempt
to please man. In doubtful cases, we are to use the
opinions of others no further than as means of directing
our own judgment. My sister has also objected to it, on
the score of my deficiency in that deep and solid experience
necessary in a missionary.</p>

<p><i>February 4.</i>&mdash;Read Lowth in the afternoon, till I was
quite tired. Endeavoured to think of Job xiv. 14, and to
have solemn thoughts of death, but could not find them
before my pupil came, to whom I explained justification by
faith, as he had ridiculed Methodism. But talk upon what
I will, or with whom I will, conversation leaves me ruffled
and discomposed. From what does this arise? From a
want of the sense of God&rsquo;s presence when I am with others.</p>

<p><i>February 6.</i>&mdash;Read the Scriptures, between breakfast
and church, in a very wandering and unsettled manner,
and in my walk was very weak in desires after God. As
I found myself about the middle of the day full of pride
and formality, I found some relief in prayer. Sat with
H. and D. after dinner, till three, but though silent, was
destitute of humility. Read some of S. Pearce&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> life, and
was much interested by his account of the workings of his
mind on the subject of his mission. Saw reason to be
thankful that I had no such tender ties to confine me at
home, as he seemed to have; and to be amazed at myself,
in not making it a more frequent object of reflection, and
yet to praise God for calling me to minister in the glorious
work of the conversion of the Gentiles.</p>

<p><i>March 27.</i>&mdash;The lectures in chemistry and anatomy I
was much engaged with, without receiving much instruction.
A violent cold and cough led me to prepare myself for an
inquiry into my views of death. I was enabled to rest
composed on the Rock of Ages. Oh, what mercy shewn
to the chief of sinners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p><i>April 22.</i>&mdash;Was ashamed to confess to <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> that I was
to be Mr. Simeon&rsquo;s curate, a despicable fear of man from
which I vainly thought myself free. He, however, asked
me if I was not to be, and so I was obliged to tell him.
Jer. i. 17.</p>

<p><i>May 8.</i>&mdash;Expressed myself contemptuously of <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who
preached at St. Mary&rsquo;s. Such manifestations of arrogance
which embody, as it were, my inward pride, wound my
spirit inexpressibly, not to contrition, but to a sullen sense
of guilt. Read Second Epistle to Timothy. I prayed with
some earnestness.</p>

<p><i>June 13</i> to <i>24</i>.&mdash;Passed in tolerable comfort upon the
whole; though I could on no day say my walk had been
close with God. Read Sir G. Staunton&rsquo;s <i>Embassy to
China</i>, and was convinced of the propriety of being sent
thither. But I have still the spirit of worldly men when I
read worldly books. I felt more curiosity about the manners
of this people than love and pity towards their souls.</p>
<hr class="shorthr" />
<p class="date">
St. John&rsquo;s, June 30, 1803.<br />
</p>

<p>Dear Sargent,&mdash;May you, as long as you shall give me
your acquaintance, direct me to the casting down of all
high imaginations. Possibly it may be a cross to you to
tell me or any one of his faults. But should I be at last
a castaway, or at least dishonour Christ through some sin,
which for want of faithful admonition remained unmortified,
how bitter would be your reflections! I conjure you,
therefore, my dear friend, as you value the good of the
souls to whom I am to preach, and my own eternal
interests, that you tell me what you think to be, in my life,
spirit, or temper, not according to the will of God my
Saviour. D. has heard about a religious young man
of seventeen, who wants to come to College, but has only
20<i>l.</i> a year. He is very clever, and from the perusal of
some poems which he has published, I am much interested
about him. His name is H.K. White.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 17.</i>&mdash;Rose at half-past five, and walked a little
before chapel in happy frame of mind; but the sunshine
was presently overcast by my carelessly neglecting to
speak for the good of two men, when I had an opportunity.
The pain was, moreover, increased by the prospect of the
incessant watchfulness for opportunities I should use; nevertheless,
resolved that I would do so through grace. The
dreadful act of disobeying God, and the baseness of being
unwilling to incur the contempt of men, for the sake of
the Lord Jesus, who had done so much for me, and the
cruelty of not longing to save souls, were the considerations
that pressed on my mind.</p>

<p><i>July 18</i> to <i>30</i>.&mdash;Gained no ground in all this time;
stayed a few days at Shelford, but was much distracted
and unsettled for want of solitude. Felt the passion of
envy rankle in my bosom on a certain occasion. Seldom
enjoyed peace, but was much under the power of corruption.
Read Butler&rsquo;s <i>Analogy</i>; Jon. Edwards <i>On the Affections</i>; in
great hopes that this book will be of essential use to me.</p>

<p><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;Was most deeply affected with reading
the account of the apostasy of Lewis and Broomhall, in the
transactions of the Missionary Society. When I first
came to the account of the awful death of the former, I
cannot describe the sense I had of the reality of religion,&mdash;that
there is a God who testifies His hatred of sin; &lsquo;my
flesh trembled for fear of His judgments.&rsquo; Afterwards,
coming to the account of Broomhall&rsquo;s sudden turn to
Deism, I could not help even bursting into tears of anxiety
and terror at my own extreme danger; because I have
often thought, that if I ever should make shipwreck, it
would be on the rocks of sensuality or infidelity. The
hollowness of Broomhall&rsquo;s arguments was so apparent, that
I could only attribute his fall to the neglect of inquiring
after the rational foundation of his faith.</p>

<p><i>September 12.</i>&mdash;Read some of the minor prophets, and
Greek Testament, and the number of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><i>Missionary
Transactions</i>. H. drank tea with me in the evening. I
read some of the missionary accounts. The account of
their sufferings and diligence could not but tend to lower
my notions of myself. I was almost ashamed at my having
such comforts about me, and at my own unprofitableness.</p>

<p><i>September 13.</i>&mdash;Received a letter from my sister, in
which she expressed her opinion of my unfitness for the
work of a missionary. My want of Christian experience
filled me with many disquieting doubts, and this thought
troubled me among many others, as it has often done: &lsquo;I
am not only not so holy as I ought, but I do not strive to
have my soul wrought up to the highest pitch of devotion
every moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>September 17.</i>&mdash;Read Dr. Vanderkemp&rsquo;s mission to Kafraria.
What a man! In heaven I shall think myself well
off, if I obtain but the lowest seat among such, though now
I am fond of giving myself a high one.</p>
<hr class="shorthr" />
<p class="date">
St. John&rsquo;s, September 29, 1803.<br />
</p>

<p>How long it seems since I heard from you, my dear
Sargent. My studies during the last three months have
been Hebrew, Greek Testament, Jon. Edwards <i>On Original
Sin</i>, and <i>On the Affections</i>, and Bishop Hopkins,&mdash;your
favourite and mine. Never did I read such energetic language,
such powerful appeals to the conscience. Somehow
or other he is able to excite most constant interest, say
what he will. I have been lately reading the first volume
of the <i>Reports</i> of the Missionary Society, who sent out so
many to Otaheite and the southern parts of Africa. You
would find the account of Dr. Vanderkemp&rsquo;s mission into
Kafraria infinitely entertaining. It appeared so much so to
me, that I could read nothing else while it lasted. Respecting
my own concerns in this way, no material change has
taken place, either externally or internally, except that my
sister thinks me unqualified, through want of religious
experience, and that I find greater pleasure at the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of it. I am conscious, however, of viewing things too much
on the bright side, and think more readily of the happiness
of seeing the desert rejoice and blossom as the rose, than of
pain, and fatigue, and crosses, and disappointments. However
it shall be determined for me, it is my duty to crush
the risings of self-will, so as to be cheerfully prepared to go
or stay.</p>

<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;In the afternoon read in Law&rsquo;s <i>Serious Call</i>,
the chapter on &lsquo;Resignation,&rsquo; and prayed for it, according
to his direction. I rather think a regular distribution of
the day for prayer, to obtain the three great graces of
humility, love, and resignation, would be far the best way
to grow in them. The music at chapel led my thoughts to
heaven, and I went cheerfully to Mrs. S.H. drank tea with
me afterwards. As there was in the <i>Christian Observer</i>
something of my own, the first which ever appeared in
print, I felt myself going off to vanity and levity.</p>

</div>

<p><i>October 9.</i>&mdash;Rose at six, which is earlier than of late, and
passed the whole morning in great tranquillity. I prayed
to be sent out to China, and rejoiced in the prospect of the
glorious day when Christ shall be glorified on earth. At
chapel the music of the chant and anthem seemed to be in
my ears as the sounds of heaven, particularly the anthem,
1 Chron. xxix. 10. But these joys, alas! partake much of
the flesh in their transitory nature. At chapel I wished to
return to my rooms to read the song of Moses the servant
of God, &amp;c. in the Revelation, but when I came to it
I found little pleasure. The sound of the music had ceased,
and with it my joy, and nothing remained but evil temper,
darkness, and unbelief. All this time I had forgotten what
it is to be a poor humble soul. I had floated off the Rock
of Ages into the deep, where I was beginning to sink, had
not the Saviour stretched out His hand, and said to me, &lsquo;It
is I!&rsquo; Let me never be cheated out of my dependence on
Him, nor ever forget my need of Him.</p>

<p><i>October 12.</i>&mdash;Reading Paley&rsquo;s <i>Evidences</i>. Had my pride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
deeply wounded to-day, and perceived that I was far from
humility. Great bitterness and dislike arose in my mind
against the man who had been the unconscious cause of it.
Oh, may I learn daily my hidden evils, and loathe myself
for my secret abominations! Prayed for the man, and
found my affections return.</p>

<p><i>October 19.</i>&mdash;I wished to have made my approaching
ordination to the ministry a more leading object of my
prayers. For two or three days I have been reading some
of St. Augustine&rsquo;s <i>Meditations</i>, and was delighted with the
hope of enjoying such communion with God as this holy
man. Blessed be God! nothing prevents, no earthly business,
no earthly love can rightfully intrude to claim my
thoughts, for I have professedly resigned them all. My
mind still continues in a joyous and happy state, though at
intervals, through want of humility, my confidence seems
vain.</p>

<p><i>October 20.</i>&mdash;This morning was almost all lost, by friends
coming in. At noon I read the fortieth chapter of Isaiah.
Amidst the bustle of common life, how frequently has my
heart been refreshed by the descriptions of the future glory
of the Church, and the happiness of man hereafter!</p>

<p><i>November 13.</i>&mdash;I longed to draw very near to God, to
pray Him that He would give me the Spirit of wisdom and
revelation. I thought of David Brainerd, and ardently
desired his devotedness to God and holy breathings of soul.</p></div>

<p>When a Fellow of St. John&rsquo;s, Henry Martyn occupied
the three rooms in the highest storey of E block, entered
from the right-hand corner of the Second Court before
passing through the gateway into the Third Court. The
Court is that pronounced by Ruskin the finest in the
University, because of the beautiful plum-red hue of the
old brick, going back to 1595, and the perfect architecture.
From the same stair the fine College Library is entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
The low roof was formed of reed, instead of lath, and
plaster, down to a very recent date. On one occasion,
while the outer roof was being repaired, the foot of a
workman suddenly pushed through the frail inner ceiling
above the study table, an incident which has enabled their
present occupant<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to identify the rooms. Here Martyn
studied, and taught, and prayed, while hour after hour and
quarter after quarter, from the spire of St. Clement&rsquo;s on the
one side, and the tower of Trinity College on the other, the
flight of time was chimed forth. When, a generation after,
Alexander Duff visited Charles Simeon and his successor,
Carus, and expressed surprise that so few Cambridge men
had, by 1836, given themselves to foreign missions, Carus
pointed to the exquisite beauty of the Cam, as it winds
between Trinity and St. John&rsquo;s, as one explanation of the
fact. Both forgot Henry Martyn, whose Cornish temperament
was most susceptible to the seductive influence, and
whose academic triumphs might have made the ideal life
of a Fellow of St. John&rsquo;s an overpowering temptation.
As we stand in these hallowed rooms, or wander through
the four courts, and in the perfect gardens, or recall the
low chapel&mdash;which has given place to Sir Gilbert Scott&rsquo;s,
with a frescoed figure of Henry Martyn on its roof&mdash;we
can realise the power of the motive that sent him forth to
Dinapore and Cawnpore, Shiraz and Tokat.</p>

<p>Samuel Pearce&mdash;the &lsquo;seraphic&rsquo; preacher of Birmingham,
whom a weak body, like Martyn&rsquo;s, alone prevented from
joining his beloved Carey at Serampore; Vanderkemp, the
Dutch physician, who had given up all for the good of the
Kafirs, and whom he was soon to see in the midst of his
converts; David Brainerd, also like himself in the shortness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and saintliness of his career; the transactions of the
London Missionary Society; the latest works on the East;
and the experimental divinity of Augustine, Jonathan
Edwards, and Law, with the writings of Bishops Butler
and Hopkins, and Dr. Paley&mdash;these were the men and
the books he used to train his spirit for the work of the
ministry abroad, when he had fed it with the words of
Jesus Christ, Isaiah, and Paul. He thus describes his
examination for Deacon&rsquo;s orders, and his ordination by the
Bishop of Ely on the title of his Fellowship, after which
he became Mr. Simeon&rsquo;s curate, and took charge of the
neighbouring small parish of Lolworth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1803, October 22.</i>&mdash;Went in a gig to Ely with B. Having
had no time for morning prayer, my conversation was poor.
At chapel, I felt great shame at having come so confidently
to offer myself for the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, with
so much ignorance and unholiness, and I thought it would
be but just if I were sent off with ignominy. Dr. M.,
the examining chaplain, set me to construe the eleventh
chapter of Matthew: Grotius: To turn the first article
into Latin: To prove the being of a God, His infinite
power and goodness: To give the evidence of Christianity
to Jews and heathens: To shew the importance of the
miracle of the resurrection of Christ. He asked an account,
also, of the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Scribes, the places of
the worship amongst the Jews, &amp;c. After leaving the palace
I was in very low spirits. I had now nothing to think of
but the weight and difficulty of the work which lay before me,
which never appeared so great at a distance. At dinner the
conversation was frivolous. After tea I was left alone with
one of the deacons, to whom I talked seriously, and desired
him to read the Ordination Service, at which he was much
affected. Retired to my room early, and besought God to
give me a right and affecting sense of things. I seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
pray a long time in vain, so dark and distracted was my
mind. At length I began to feel the shameful and cruel
neglect and unconcern for the honour of God, and the souls
of my brethren, in having trifled with men whom I feared
were about to &lsquo;lie to the Holy Ghost.&rsquo; So I went to them
again, resolving to lay hold on any opportunity, but found
none to do anything effectually. Went to bed with a
painful sense of my hardness of heart and unsuitable
preparation for the ministry.</p>

<p><i>October 23.</i>&mdash;Rose early, and prayed, not without distraction.
I then walked, but could not acquire a right and
happy sense of God&rsquo;s mercy in calling me to the ministry;
but was melancholy at the labours that awaited me. On
returning, I met one of the deacons, to whom I spoke on
the solemn occasion, but he seemed incapable of entertaining
a serious thought. At half-past ten we went to the
cathedral. During the ordination and sacramental services
I sought in vain for a humble heavenly mind. The outward
show which tended to inspire solemnity, affected me
more than the faith of Christ&rsquo;s presence, giving me the
commission to preach the gospel. May I have grace to
fulfil those promises I made before God and the people!
After dinner, walked with great rapidity to Cambridge.
I went straight to Trinity Church, where my old vanities
assailed my soul. How monstrous and horrible did they
appear in me, now that I was a minister of holy things! I
could scarcely believe that so sacred an office should be
held by one who had such a heart within. B. sat with
me in the evening, but I was not humbled; for I had not
been near to God to obtain the grace of contrition.
On going to prayer at night, I was seized with a most
violent sickness. In the pain and disorder of my body,
I could but commend myself faintly to God&rsquo;s mercy in Jesus
Christ.</p>

</div>

<p><i>October 24</i> to <i>29</i>.&mdash;Busily employed in writing a sermon,
and from the slow advances I made in it, was in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
very melancholy. I read on the Thursday night for the
first time in Trinity Church.</p>

<p><i>October 30.</i>&mdash;Rose with a heavy heart, and my head
empty, from having read so little of the Scriptures this last
week. After church, sat with <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> two hours conversing about
the missionary plan. He considered my ideas on the subject
to be enthusiastic, and told me that I had neither strength
of body nor mind for the work. This latter defect I did not
at all like; it was galling to the pride of my heart, and I
went to bed hurt; yet thankful to God for sending me one
who would tell me the truth.</p>

<p><i>December 3.</i>&mdash;Employed all day in writing sermon.
The incessant employment of my thoughts about the
necessary business of my life, parishes, pupils, sermons, sick,
&amp;c., leave far too little time for my private meditations; so
that I know little of God and my soul. Resolved I would
gain some hours from my usual sleep, if there were no
other way; but failed this morning in consequence of sitting
up so late.</p>

<p><i>December 4.</i>&mdash;Called at two or three of the parishioners&rsquo;
houses, and found them universally in the most profound
state of ignorance and stupidity. On my road home could
not perceive that men who have any little knowledge should
have anything to do but instruct their wretched fellow-creatures.
The pursuits of science, and all the vain and
glittering employments of men, seemed a cruel withholding
from their perishing brethren of that time and exertion
which might save their souls.</p>

<p><i>December 22.</i>&mdash;Married <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>. How satisfactory is it
to administer the ordinance of matrimony, where the
couple are pious! I felt thankful that I was delivered
from all desires of the comforts of the married life. With
the most desirable partner, and every prospect of
happiness, I would prefer a single life, in which there
are so much greater opportunities for heavenly-mindedness.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>When appointed classical examiner of his college at
this time, he jealously examined himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Did I delight in reading of the retreat of the ten
thousand Greeks; and shall not my soul glory in the
knowledge of God, who created the Greeks, and the vast
countries over which they passed! I examined in Butler&rsquo;s
<i>Analogy</i> and in Xenophon: how much pride and ostentatious
display of learning was visible in my conduct&mdash;how
that detestable spirit follows me, whatever I do!</p></div>

<p>He opened the year 1804, after preaching in Trinity
Church, and visiting two men whom he exhorted to think
on their ways, with a review of his new-found life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nevertheless, I judge that I have grown in grace in the
course of the last year; for the bent of my desires is towards
God more than when I thought I was going out as a
missionary, though vastly less than I expected it would
have been by this time.</p></div>

<p>This year he received into his fellowship the young
poet, Henry Kirke White, whom Wilberforce had, at
Simeon&rsquo;s request, sent to St. John&rsquo;s. Southey declares
that Chatterton is the only youthful poet whom Kirke
White does not leave far behind him. &lsquo;The Star of
Bethlehem&rsquo; is certainly a hymn that will live. The sickly
youth followed close in Martyn&rsquo;s steps, becoming the first
man of his year, but the effort carried him off almost
before his friend reached India.</p>

<p>Had Martyn been of canonical age for ordination at the
close of 1803, there can be little doubt that he would at
once have been sent out by the Church Missionary Society,
which could find only German Lutherans as its agents
abroad, until 1813, when another Fellow of St. John&rsquo;s, and
a Wrangler, the Rev. William Jowett, offered his services,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and was stationed at Malta. But when ordained he lost
the little that he had inherited from his father, and saw
his younger sister also without resources. There was a
tradition in the family of his half-brother John, that Henry
and his sisters litigated with him, and farther lessened the
patrimony. However that may have been, while in India
Henry set apart the proceeds of his Fellowship at St. John&rsquo;s
for the maintenance of his brother&rsquo;s family, and bequeathed
all he had to his children. Mr. H. Thornton, of Clapham,
was executor, and duly carried out his instructions, starting
the nephews in life. Another incident at this time foreshadows
the self-denial of his Indian career. By opening
the door of his room suddenly he had disfigured the face
of his Cambridge landlady, whose husband was a clergyman.
He left to her the interest of 1,000<i>l.</i> as an amend,
and she enjoyed this annuity through a very long life.</p>

<p>The Senior Wrangler was not allowed to preach in the
church where he had been baptised, nor in any church of
his native county, save in his brother-in-law&rsquo;s. On August 8,
1804, he thus wrote to his friend &lsquo;R. Boys, Esq., Bene&rsquo;t Coll.,
Cambridge,&rsquo; after preaching at Plymouth for his cousin:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following Sunday it was not permitted me to occupy
the pulpit of my native town, but in a neighbouring church
I was allowed to testify the Gospel of the grace of God.
But that one sermon was enough. The clergy seem to
have united to exclude me from their churches, so that I
must now be contented with my brother-in-law&rsquo;s two little
churches about five miles from Truro. The objection is that
&lsquo;Mr. Martyn is a Calvinist preacher in the dissenting way, &amp;c.&rsquo;
My old schoolmaster, who has always hitherto been proud
of his pupil, has offered his services for any time to a curate
near this place, rather than, as he said, he should apply to
me for assistance.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>It is interesting to remember, remarks Mr. Moule, who
has published this letter for the first time, that &lsquo;always
now, as the anniversary of Martyn&rsquo;s death recurs, a sermon
is preached in the cathedral of Truro, in which the great
work of Missions is set forth, and his illustrious share in it
commemorated.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As confidential adviser of Charles Grant in the Court
of Directors, in the appointment of chaplains, Simeon
always sought to attract the best of his curates to that
career, and it would appear from the <i>Journal</i> that so early
as the beginning of 1803 he had hinted at this to Martyn.
Now the way was plain. Martyn could no longer support
himself as one of those volunteer missionaries whose services
the two great missionary societies of the Church of England
have always been happy to enjoy, nor could he relieve his
sister out of the subsistence allowance of a missionary. Mr.
Grant&rsquo;s offer of a Bengal chaplaincy seemed to come to
him as the solution. But a new element had entered into
his life, second only to his spiritual loyalty. He had learned
to love Lydia Grenfell.</p>

&lsquo;Henry Martyn had just entered the College as a Freshman under the
Rev. Mr. Catton. I was the year above him, <i>i.e.</i> second year man; and Mr.
Catton sent for me to his rooms, telling me of Martyn, as a quiet youth, with
some knowledge of classics, but utterly unable as it seemed to make anything
of even the First Proposition of Euclid, and desiring me to have him into my
rooms, and see what I could do for him in this matter. Accordingly, we spent
some time together, but all my efforts appeared to be in vain; and Martyn, in
sheer despair, was about to make his way to the coach office, and take his
place the following day back to Truro, his native town. I urged him not to
be so precipitate, but to come to me the next day, and have another trial
with Euclid. After some time light seemed suddenly to flash upon his mind,
with clear comprehension of the hitherto dark problem, and he threw up his
cap for joy at his <i>Eureka</i>. The Second Proposition was soon taken, and with
perfect success; but in truth his progress was such and so rapid, that he
distanced every one in his year, and, as everyone knows, became Senior
Wrangler.&rsquo;</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="subheading">LYDIA GRENFELL</p>


<p>Twenty-six miles south-west of Truro, and now the last
railway station before Penzance is reached for the Land&rsquo;s
End, is Marazion, the oldest, the warmest, and long the
dullest, of English towns. This was the home of Lydia
Grenfell; this was the scene of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s wooing.
Running out from the town is a natural causeway, uncovered
at low tide, and leading to the most romantic spot
on a romantic coast&mdash;the granite rock known to the Greek
geographers as Ictis, and to English legend and history as
St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount. Here it was that Jack slew the giant,
Cormoran; here that the Phœnician, and possibly Israelite,
traffickers found the harbour, and in the town the market,
where they bought their copper and their tin; here that
St. Michael appeared, as on the larger rock off Normandy,
to the earliest Christian hermits, followed by the Benedictines;
and here that King John made a fortress which both
sides in the Great Rebellion held and took alternately.
Since that time, possessed by the St. Aubyn family, and
open to all the world, St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount has been a
unique retreat in which castle and chapel, cemetery and
garden, unite peacefully, to link the restlessness of the
nineteenth century with the hermit saintliness and angel-ophanies
of the fifth. It was the last spot of English, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Cornish, ground seen by Henry Martyn, and he knew that
the windows of his beloved looked upon its grassy castellated
height.</p>

<p>In the one ascending street of Marazion on the shore,
there still stands the plain substantial Grenfell House, now
boarded up and falling to ruin for want of the freehold
tenure. Opposite it is the parish church, now on the site
of the old chapel of ease of the neighbouring St. Hilary,
which Lydia Grenfell deserted for the then warmer evangelical
service of the little Wesleyan chapel. That is
hidden in a lane, and is still the same as when she worshipped
there, or only a little enlarged. The Grenvilles,
Grenviles, or Grenfells, were long a leading family connected
with Cornwall as copper-buyers and smelters. One, Pascoe
Grenfell, was a Governor of the Bank of England. Mr.
Pascoe Grenfell, of Marazion (1729-1810), Commissary to
the States of Holland, was father (1) of Emma, who became
wife of Martyn&rsquo;s cousin, Rev. T. Martyn Hitchins; (2) of
Lydia Grenfell; and (3) of Pascoe Grenfell, D.C.L., M.P.
for Marlow and Penryn. This Pascoe&rsquo;s four daughters&mdash;Lydia
Grenfell&rsquo;s nieces&mdash;each became the wife of a remarkable
man. The eldest, in 1825, married Mr. Carr Glyn, M.P.
for Kendal, and the first Lord Wolverton; the second, Lord
Sidney Godolphin Osborne; the third, Mr. James Anthony
Froude; and the fourth, Charles Kingsley.</p>

<span class="caption">ST. MICHAEL&rsquo;S MOUNT AT FULL TIDE.</span>
</div>

<p>Lydia Grenfell, born in 1775, died in her sister&rsquo;s house,
the old Vicarage of Breage, in 1829. She was thus six
years older than Henry Martyn. As the sister of his
cousin by marriage he must have known of her early. He
evidently did not know, till it was too late, that she had
been engaged to a Mr. Samuel John, solicitor, of Penzance,
who was unworthy of her and married someone else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
This engagement and its issue seem to have weighed on
her very sensitive conscience; it became to her very much
what Henry Martyn&rsquo;s hopeless love for her proved to be to
himself. In the years from October 19, 1801, to 1826, she
kept a diary not less devout, but far more morbid than
his own. The two journals form, where they meet, a
pathetic, even tragic, tale of affection, human and divine.
Her bulky memoranda<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> contain few incidents of interest,
rather severe introspections, incessant communings and
heart-searchings, abstracts of sermons, records of visits to
the sick and poor, but also a valuable residuum by which
her relations with Martyn can be established beyond controversy.
They show that she was as saintly as himself.
She weighed every thought, every action, as in the immediate
presence of God.</p>

<p>When Henry Martyn, at nineteen, entered on the
higher life, he must have known Lydia Grenfell as the
sister of Mrs. T.M. Hitchins, the cousin with whom his
correspondence shows him to have been on most intimate,
and even affectionate, terms. At that time the difference
of age would seem slight; her it would affect little, if at all,
while common experience suggests that it would be even
attractive to him. With the ardour of a young disciple&mdash;which
in his case grew, year by year, till he passed away&mdash;he
sought spiritual counsel and communion. On his visits
to Cornwall he found both in his younger sister, but it is
evident that, from the first, the riper spiritual life of Lydia
Grenfell attracted him to her. His triumph, at twenty, as
Senior Wrangler put him quite in a position to dream of
winning her. His unexpected poverty was relieved by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Fellowship of St. John&rsquo;s. In those days, however, that
would have ceased with marriage. When it became
more than probable that he would receive an appointment
to Bengal, through Mr. Charles Grant&mdash;either as minister
of the Mission Church founded by Kiernander, or as a
chaplain of the East India Company&mdash;he was face to
face with the question of marrying.</p>

<p>In these days the course followed by missionary
societies as the result of experience is certainly the best.
A missionary and a chaplain in India should, in ordinary
circumstances, be married, but it is not desirable that the
marriage take place for a year or longer, until the young
minister has proved the climate, and has learned the native
language, when the lady can be sent out to be united to
him. At the beginning of the modern missionary enterprise,
a century ago, it was difficult to find spiritual men
willing to go to India on any terms, and they did well in
every case to go out married. All the conditions of time,
distance, society, and Christian influence were then different.
If the missionary&rsquo;s or chaplain&rsquo;s wife is worthy of his calling,
she doubles his usefulness, notwithstanding the cares
and the expense of children in many cases, alike by keeping
her husband in a state of efficiency on every side, by
her own works of charity and self-sacrifice&mdash;especially
among the women, who can be reached in no other way&mdash;and
by helping to present to the idolatrous or Mussulman
community the powerful example of a Christian home.
Henry Martyn&rsquo;s principles and instincts were right in this
matter. As a chaplain, at any rate, he was in a position
to marry at once. As India or Bengal then was, Lydia,
had she gone out with him, or soon after him, would have
proved to be a much needed force in Anglo-Indian society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
an influence on the native communities whom he sought
to bring to Christ. Above all, as a man born with a
weak body, with habits of incessant and intense application
to study and to duty, Henry Martyn required one with the
influence of a wife to keep him in life and to prolong his
Indian service. It was the greatest calamity of his whole
career that Lydia did not accompany him. But, since he
learned to love her with all the rich devotion of his passionate
nature, we cannot consider it &lsquo;a bitter misfortune,&rsquo; as
some do, that he ever knew her. His love for Lydia, in
the fluctuations of its hope, in the ebb and flow of its
tenderness, and in the transmutation of its despair into
faith and resignation to the will of God, worked out a
higher elevation for himself, and gives to his <i>Journals and
Letters</i> a pure human interest which places them above the
<i>Confessions of St. Augustine</i>.</p>

<p>The first allusion to the possibility of marriage we find
in his <i>Journal</i> of January 23, 1803, and again in June 12
of the same year:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was grieved to find that all the exertions of prayer
were necessary against worldly-mindedness, so soon had
the prospect of the means of competent support in India
filled my heart with concern about earthly happiness,
marriage, &amp;c.; but I strove earnestly against them, and
prayed for grace that, if it should please God to try my
faith by calling me to a post of opulence, I might not dare
to use for myself what is truly His; as also, that I might
be enabled to keep myself single, for serving Him more
effectually. Nevertheless, this change in my circumstances
so troubled me, that I could have been infinitely better
pleased to have gone out as a missionary, poor as the Lord
and His Apostles.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>His friend Sargent&rsquo;s &lsquo;approaching marriage with a lady
of uncommon excellence rather excited in me a desire
after a similar state; but I strove against it,&rsquo; he wrote on
July 10. Next day, on the top of the coach from London
to Bath, in the cold of a high wind, he was &lsquo;most dreadfully
assailed by evil thoughts, but at the very height
prayer prevailed, and I was delivered, and during the rest
of the journey enjoyed great peace and a strong desire to
live for Christ alone, forsaking the pleasures of the world,
marriage, &amp;c.&rsquo; At Plymouth he spent two days &lsquo;with my
dear cousin T.H.,&rsquo; Lydia&rsquo;s sister. After Truro, Kenwyn,
and Lamorran, near Truro, of which his sister Sarah&rsquo;s husband
was vicar, he rode to St. Hilary.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1804, July 29.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Read and prayed in the
morning before service with seriousness, striving against
those thoughts which oppressed me all the rest of the day.
At St. Hilary Church in the morning my thoughts wandered
from the service, and I suffered the keenest disappointment.
Miss L.G. did not come. Yet, in great
pain, I blessed God for having kept her away, as she might
have been a snare to me. These things would be almost
incredible to another, and almost to myself, were I not
taught by daily experience that, whatever the world may
say, or I may think of myself, I am a poor, wretched,
sinful, contemptible worm.</p>

<p>Called after tea on Miss L.G., and walked with her
and <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, conversing on spiritual subjects. All the rest of
the evening, and at night, I could not keep her out of my
mind. I felt too plainly that I loved her passionately.
The direct opposition of this to my devotedness to God in
the missionary way, excited no small tumult in my mind.
In conversation, having no divine sweetness in peace, my
cheerfulness was affected, and, consequently, very hurtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to my conscience. At night I continued an hour and a
half in prayer, striving against this attachment. I endeavoured
to analyse it, that I might see how base, and
mean, and worthless such a love to a speck of earth was,
compared with divine love. Then I read the most solemn
parts of Scripture, to realise to myself death and eternity;
and these attempts were sometimes blest. One while I
was about to triumph, but in a moment my heart had
wandered to the beloved idol. I went to bed in great
pain, yet still rather superior to the evening; but in dreams
her image returned, and I awoke in the night with my
mind full of her. No one can say how deeply this unhappy
affection has fixed itself; since it has nothing selfish in it,
that I can perceive, but is founded on the highest admiration
of her piety and manners.</p>

<p><i>July 30.</i>&mdash;Rose in great peace. God, by secret influence,
seemed to have caused the tempest of self-will to subside.
Rode away from St. Hilary to Gwennap in peace of mind,
and meditated most of the way on Romans viii. I again
devoted myself to the Lord, and with more of my will
than last night. I was much disposed to think of subjects
entirely placed beyond the world, and had strong desires,
though with heavy opposition from my corrupt nature,
after that entire deadness to the world which David
Brainerd manifested. At night I found myself to have
backslidden a long way from the life of godliness, to have
declined very much since my coming into Cornwall, but
especially since I went to St. Hilary. Sat up late, and read
the last chapter and other parts of Revelation, and was
deeply affected. Prayed with more success than lately.</p>

<p><i>July 31.</i>&mdash;Read and prayed this morning with increasing
victory over my self-will. Romans vii. was particularly
suitable; it was agreeable to me to speak to God of my
own corruption and helplessness. Walked in the afternoon
to Redruth, after having prayed over the Epistle to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Ephesians with much seriousness. On the road I was
enabled to triumph at last, and found my heart as pleased
with the prospect of a single life in missionary labours as
ever. &lsquo;What is the exceeding greatness of His power to
usward who believe!&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>After preaching to crowds in his brother-in-law&rsquo;s church
at Kenwyn and Lamorran, on the two subsequent Sundays,
he walked to St. Hilary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1804, August 26.</i>&mdash;Rose early, and walked out, invited
by the beauty of the morning. Many different pleasing
thoughts crowded on my mind, as I viewed the sea and
rocks, Mount and bay, and thought of the person who
lived near it; but, for want of checking my natural spirits,
and fixing on one subject of thought, I was not much
benefited by my meditations. Walked in the evening
with Mrs. G. and Lydia up the hill, with the most beautiful
prospect of the sea, &amp;c.; but I was unhappy, from feeling
the attachment to Lydia, for I was unwilling to leave her.</p>

<p><i>August 27.</i>&mdash;Walked to Marazion, with my heart more
delivered from its idolatry, and enabled to look steadily
and peacefully to God. Reading in the afternoon to Lydia
alone, from Dr. Watts, there happened to be, among other
things, a prayer on entire preference of God to the creature.
Now, thought I, here am I in the presence of God, and my
idol. So I used the prayer for myself, and addressed it to
God, who answered it, I think, for my love was kindled
to God and divine things, and I felt cheerfully resigned to
the will of God, to forego the earthly joy which I had just
been desiring with my whole heart. I continued conversing
with her, generally with my heart in heaven, but every now
and then resting on her. Parted with Lydia, perhaps for
ever in this life, with a sort of uncertain pain, which I knew
would increase to greater violence afterwards, on reflection.
Walked to St. Hilary, determining, in great tumult and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
inward pain, to be the servant of God. All the rest of the
evening, in company or alone, I could think of nothing
but her excellences. My efforts were, however, through
mercy, not in vain, to feel the vanity of this attachment to
the creature. Read in Thomas à Kempis many chapters
directly to the purpose; the shortness of time, the awfulness
of death and its consequences, rather settled my mind
to prayer. I devoted myself unreservedly to the service
of the Lord, to Him, as to one who knew the great conflict
within, and my firm resolve, through His grace, of being
His, though it should be with much tribulation.</p>

<p><i>August 28.</i>&mdash;Rose with a heavy heart, and took leave
of St. Hilary, where all the happier hours of my early life
were passed. <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> accompanied me in the chaise
a few miles; but the moment they left me I walked on,
dwelling at large on the excellence of Lydia. I had a few
faint struggles to forget her, and delight in God, but they
were ineffectual. Among the many motives to the subjection
of self-will, I found the thought of the entire unworthiness
of a soul escaped from hell to choose its own
will before God&rsquo;s, most bring my soul to a right frame.
So that, while I saw the necessity of resigning, for the
service of God, all those joys, for the loss of which I could
not perceive how anything in heaven or earth could be a
compensation, I said, Amen!</p>

<p><i>August 29.</i>&mdash;I walked to Truro, with my mind almost
all the way taken up with Lydia. But once reasoning in
this way&mdash;If God made me, and wills my happiness, as I do
not doubt, then He is providing for my good by separating
me from her; this reasoning convinced my mind. I felt
very solemnly and sweetly the excellence of serving God
faithfully, of following Christ and His Apostles, and meditated
with great joy on the approach of the end of this
world. Yet still I enjoyed, every now and then, the
thought of walking hereafter with her, in the realms of
glory, conversing on the things of God. My mind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
rest of the evening was much depressed. I had no desire
to live in this world; scarcely could I say where I would
be, or what I would do, now that my self-will was so
strongly counteracted. Thus God waits patiently my return
from my backsliding, which I would do immediately.
If He were to offer me the utmost of my wishes, I would
say, &lsquo;Not so, Lord! Not my will, but Thine be done.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>August 30.</i>&mdash;Passed the morning rather idly, in reading
lives of pious women. I felt an indescribable mixture of
opposing emotions. At one time, about to ascend with
delight to God, who had permitted me to aspire after the
same glory, but oftener called down to earth by my earthly
good. Major Sandys calling, continued till dinner conversing
about India. I consented to stay a day with him
at Helston, but the thought of being so near Marazion
renewed my pain, especially taken in connection with my
going thither on the subject of my departure. After dinner,
walked in the garden for two hours, reasoning with my
perverse heart, and, through God&rsquo;s mercy, not without
success. You preach up deadness to the world, and yet
not an example of it! Now is the time, my soul, if you
cannot feel that it is best to bear the cross, to trust God
for it. This will be true faith. If I were put in possession
of my idol, I should immediately say and feel that God
alone was, notwithstanding, the only good, and to Him I
should seek immediately. Again I weighed the probable
temporal consequence of having my own will gratified;
the dreadful pain of separation by death, after being united,
together with the distress I might bring upon her whom I
loved. All these things were of small influence till I read
the Epistle to the Hebrews, by which my mind, made to
consider divine things attentively, was much more freed
from earthly things. &lsquo;Let us come boldly to the throne
of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help
in time of need,&rsquo; was very precious and comforting to me.
I have found grace to help in this time of need; I still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
want a humble spirit to wait upon the Lord. I almost
called God to witness that I duly resigned my pleasure to
His, as if I wished it to be remembered. In the evening
had a serious and solemn time in prayer, chiefly for the
influences of the Spirit, and rose with my thoughts fixed
on eternity; I longed for death, and called on the glorious
day to hasten; but it was in order to be free from the
troubles of this world.</p>

<p><i>August 31.</i>&mdash;Passed the morning partly in reading and
writing, but chiefly in business. Rode to Rosemundy,
with my mind at first very unhappy, at the necessity of
mortifying my self-will, in the same particulars as for some
days. In conversing on the subject of India with Major
Sandys, I could not help communicating the pain I felt at
parting with the person to whom I was attached; but by
thus dwelling on the subject my heart was far more distressed
than ever. Found my mind more easy and submissive
to God at night in prayer.</p></div>

<p>St. Hilary Church, in which Henry Martyn preached,
is one of the oldest in England, containing, in the tower
of Edward III.&rsquo;s reign, two stones with inscriptions of the
time of the Emperor Flavius Constantinus, who was killed
by Honorius in 411. What Lydia Grenfell thought of
Martyn&rsquo;s sermon on that day, August 26, thenceforth
memorable to both, we find in her <i>Diary</i> of that date:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1804, August 26.</i>&mdash;Heard H.M. on &lsquo;Now then we are
ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you
by us: we pray you, in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled to
God. For He hath made Him to be sin (<i>i.e.</i> sin-offering)
for us, Who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in Him.&rsquo; Exordium on the honourable
employment of a minister of the Gospel. In the text
two things were implied. First, we were at enmity with
God. Second, we were unable to restore ourselves to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
favour. There were two things expressed in the text&mdash;the
means of reconciliation, and God&rsquo;s invitation to be
reconciled; a threefold address to saints, backsliders, and
sinners; and a farewell address. A precious sermon.
Lord, bless the preacher, and those that heard him!</p></div>

<p>At that time, in 1804, the lady was still preoccupied,
in conscience or heart, or both, by her imaginary ties to
Mr. S. John. But six months before that she had heard of
his approaching marriage, though, in fact, that did not take
place till 1810. All that time, if she did not feel, to one
to whom her heart had been more closely united than to
any &lsquo;earthly object,&rsquo; as she had written in her <i>Diary</i>, what
Mr. H.M. Jeffery describes as the attachment of a widow
with the responsibility of a wife, her scrupulous introspective
habit was an obstacle to a healthy attachment. The
preacher, younger than herself, was in 1804 evidently to
her only an interesting and gracious second cousin, or
perhaps a little more.</p>

<p>On his way back to London Henry Martyn again
visited Plymouth, where he learned from his cousin &lsquo;that
my attachment to her sister was not altogether unreturned,
and the discovery gave me both pleasure and pain.&rsquo; He
left them, his thoughts &lsquo;almost wholly occupied with
Lydia.&rsquo; London, Cambridge, his reading and his walking,
his work and even his sleep, bring him no rest from the
absorbing passion. His <i>Journal</i> is full of it, almost every
day. Fortescue&rsquo;s poems recall the happy mornings at St.
Hilary, but his pensive meditation subsided into a more
profitable one on the vanity of the world: &lsquo;they marry and
are given in marriage,&rsquo; and at the end of a few years what
are they more than myself?&mdash;looking forward to the same
dissolution, and expecting their real happiness in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
life. &lsquo;The fashion of this world passeth away,&rsquo; Amen.
&lsquo;Let me do the will of God while I am in it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The first day of the year 1805 led him to review the
past five years, and to renew his self-dedication to God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be His servant for ever.
The time for his departure to India was at hand, and his
last act, on leaving London for Cambridge, to complete his
arrangements for sailing, was deliberately to engage himself
to Lydia Grenfell in the following letter to her sister.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
It is thus referred to in his <i>Journal</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was in some doubt whether I should send the letter
to Emma, as it was taking a very important step, and I
could scarcely foresee all the consequences. However, I
did send it, and may now be said to have engaged myself
to Lydia.</p>
<hr class="shorthr" />
<p class="date">
18 Brunswick Square (London), January 11, 1805.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear Mrs. Hitchins,&mdash;How unaccountable must my
long silence appear to you after the conversation that
passed between us in the carriage! You may well wonder
that I could forbear, for three whole months, to inquire
about the &lsquo;beloved Persis.&rsquo; Indeed, I am surprised at my
own patience, but, in truth, I found it impossible to discover
what it is which I wish or ought to say on the subject,
and therefore determined to defer writing till I could
inform you with certainty of my future destination. But
I have it not yet in my power to do this, for no actual
appointment has been made for me yet. I came to town
the beginning of this week to inquire into the present
state of the business, and learned from Mr. Grant that
the situation he intended to procure, and to which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
no doubt of getting me nominated, was not in the Army,
but at Fort William, near Calcutta. Thus it pleases God
to suspend the declaration of His mind, and I can believe
that He acts wisely. These apparent delays serve to check
my youthful impetuosity, and teach me to look up to God,
and wait for Him. If the chaplaincy at Fort William
should be given me, it would seem to be His design not to
call me to the peculiar work of a missionary, but to fix my
station among the English. At present my own inclination
remains almost unbiassed, as to the particular employment
or place God shall assign me, whether to pass my days
among the natives, or the more polished inhabitants of
Calcutta, or even to remain at home.</p>

<p>But you will easily conceive that the increasing probability
of my being settled in a town rather tends to
revive the thoughts of marriage, for I feel very little doubt
in my own mind, that in such a situation it would be expedient
for me on the whole to marry, if other circumstances
permitted it. It is also as clear that I ought not to make
an engagement with any one in England, till I have ascertained
by actual observation in India, what state of life
and mode of proceeding would be most conducive to the
ends of my mission. But why do I mention these difficulties?
If they were removed, others would remain still
more insurmountable. The affections of the beloved object
in question must still be engaged in my favour, or even
then she would not agree to leave the kingdom, nor would
any of you agree to it, nor would such a change of climate,
it may be thought, suit the delicacy of her constitution.</p>

<p>Must I, then, yield to the force of these arguments, and
resolve to think of her no more? It shall certainly be my
endeavour, by the help of my God, to do it, if need be; but
I confess I am very unwilling to go away and hear of her
only accidentally through the medium of others. It is
this painful reflection that has prompted a wish, which I
do not mention without some hesitation, and that is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
wish of corresponding with her. It is possible you may
instantly perceive some impropriety in it which escapes
my notice, and indeed there are some objections which I
foresee might be made, but instead of anticipating them, I
will leave you to form your own opinion. In religion we
have a subject to write upon of equal interest to us both,
and though I cannot expect she would derive any advantage
from my letters, it is certain I should receive no small
benefit from hers. But I leave it with yourself; if you
disapprove of the measure, let the request be forgotten. It
will be best for her never to know I had made it, or if she
does, she will, I hope, pardon a liberty to which I have
been drawn only by the love of her excellence.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;I remember <i>Leighton</i>; take care not to forget it
nor the desired MS.</p></div>

<p>On June 1 he wrote in his <i>Journal</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My departure from my friends, and my deprivation of
the sweetest delight in society, for ever in this life, have
rather dejected me to-day. Ah! Nature, thou hast still
tears to shed for thyself!... I seem to be hankering after
something or other in this world, though I am sure I could
not say there is anything which I believed could give me
happiness. No! it is in God above. Yet to-night I have
been thinking much of Lydia. Memory has been at work
to unnerve my soul, but reason, and honour, and love to
Christ and to souls, shall prevail. Amen. God help me!</p></div>

<p>Two days after, at the Eclectic Society, after a discussion
on the symptoms of &lsquo;the state of the nation,&rsquo; the subject of
marriage, somehow or other, came to be mentioned.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Cecil spoke very freely and strongly on the subject.
He said I should be acting like a madman if I went out
unmarried. A wife would supply by her comfort and
counsel the entire want of society, and also be a preservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
both to character and passions amidst such scenes. I felt
as cold as an anchorite on the subject as to my own feelings,
but I was much perplexed all the rest of the evening about
it. I clearly perceived that my own inclination upon the
whole was not to marriage. The fear of being involved in
worldly cares and numberless troubles, which I do not now
foresee, makes me tremble and dislike the thoughts of such
connection. When I think of Brainerd, how he lived
among the Indians, travelling freely from place to place,
can I conceive he would have been so useful had he been
married? I remember also that Owens, who had been so
many years in the West Indies as a missionary, gave his
advice against marriage. Schwartz was never married, nor
St. Paul. On the other hand, when I suppose another in
my circumstances, fixed at a settlement without company,
without society, in a scene and climate of such temptation,
I say without hesitation, he ought to be married. I have
recollected this evening very much my feelings when I
walked through Wales; how I longed there to have some
friend to speak to; and the three weeks seemed an age
without one. And I have often thought how valuable
would be the counsel and comfort of a Christian brother in
India. These advantages would be obtained by marrying.
I feel anxious also that as many Christians as possible
should go to India, and anyone willing to go would be a
valuable addition. But yet voluntary celibacy seems so
much more noble and glorious, and so much more beneficial
in the way of example, that I am loth to relinquish
the idea of it. In short, I am utterly at a loss to know
what is best for the interests of the Gospel. But, happily,
my own peace is not much concerned in it. If this opinion
of so many pious clergymen had come across me when I
was in Cornwall, and so strongly attached to my beloved
Lydia, it would have been a conflict indeed in my heart to
oppose so many arguments. But now I feel, through grace,
an astonishing difference. I hope I am not seeking an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
excuse for marriage, nor persuading myself I am indifferent
about it, in order that what is really my inclination may
appear to be the will of God. But I feel my affections
kindling to their wonted fondness while I dwell on the
circumstances of a union with Lydia. May the Lord
teach His weak creature to live peacefully and soberly in
His love, drawing all my joys from Him, the fountain of
living waters.</p>

<p><i>June 4.</i>&mdash;The subject of marriage made me thoughtful
and serious. Mr. Atkinson, whose opinion I revere, was
against my marrying. Found near access to my God in
prayer. Oh, what a comfort it is to have God to go to.
I breathed freely to Him my sorrows and cares, and set
about my work with diligence. The Lord assisted me
very much, and I wrote more freely than ever I did. Slept
very little in the night.</p>

<p><i>June 5.</i>&mdash;Corrie breakfasted with me, and went to
prayer; I rejoiced to find he was not unwilling to go to
India. He will probably be my fellow-labourer. Most of
this morning was employed in writing all my sentiments
on the subject of marriage to Mr. Simeon. May the Lord
suggest something to him which may be of use to guide
me, and keep my eye single. In my walk out, and afterwards,
the subject was constantly on my mind. But, alas!
I did not guard against that distraction from heavenly
things which I was aware it would occasion. On reflection
at home, I found I had been talking in a very inconsistent
manner, but was again restored to peace by an application
to Christ&rsquo;s blood through the Spirit. My mind has all this
day been very strongly inclined to marriage, and has been
consequently uncomfortable, for in proportion to its want
of simplicity it is unhappy. But Mr. Cecil said to-day, he
thought Lydia&rsquo;s decision would fully declare the will of
God. With this I am again comforted, for now hath the
Lord taken the matter into His own hands. Whatever
He decides upon, I shall rejoice; and though I confess I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
think she will not consent to go, I shall then have the
question finally settled.</p>

<p>Discussion in the evening was about my marriage
again; they were all strenuous advocates for it. Wrote
at night with great freedom, but my body is very weak
from the fatigue I have already undergone. My mind
seems very active this week; manifestly, indeed, strengthened
by God to be enabled to write on religious subjects
with such unusual ease, while it is also full of this important
business of the marriage. My inclination continues, I
think, far more unbiassed than when I wrote to Mr.
Simeon.</p>

<p><i>June 7.</i>&mdash;Oh, the subtlety of the devil, and the deceitfulness
of this corrupted heart! How has an idol been
imperceptibly raised up in it. Something fell from Dr. F.
this evening against my marriage which struck me so
forcibly, though there was nothing particular in it, that
I began to see I should finally give up all thoughts about
it. But how great the conflict! I could not have believed
it had such hold on my affections. Before this I had been
writing in tolerable tranquillity, and walked out in the
enjoyment of a resigned mind, even rejoicing for the most
part in God, and dined at Mr. Cecil&rsquo;s, where the arguments
I heard were all in favour of the flesh, and so I was pleased;
but Dr. F.&rsquo;s words gave a new turn to my thoughts, and
the tumult showed me the true state of my heart. How
miserable did life appear without the hope of Lydia! Oh,
how has the discussion of the subject opened all my wounds
afresh! I have not felt such heartrending pain since I
parted with her in Cornwall. But the Lord brought me
to consider the folly and wickedness of all this. Shall I
hesitate to keep my days in constant solitude, who am but
a brand plucked from the burning? I could not help
saying, &lsquo;Go, Hindus, go on in your misery; let Satan still
rule over you; for he that was appointed to labour among
you is consulting his ease.&rsquo; No, thought I; hell and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
earth shall never keep me back from my work. I am cast
down, but not destroyed; I began to consider, why am I
so uneasy? &lsquo;Cast thy care upon Him, for He careth for
you.&rsquo; &lsquo;In everything, by prayer,&rsquo; &amp;c. These promises
were graciously fulfilled before long to me.</p>

<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;My mind continued in much the same state
this morning, waiting with no small anxiety for a letter
from Mr. Simeon, hoping, of course, that the will of God
would coincide with my will, yet thinking the determination
of the question would be indifferent to me. When the
letter arrived I was immediately convinced, beyond all
doubt, of the expediency of celibacy. But my wish did
not follow my judgment quite so readily. Mr. Pratt
coming in, argued strongly on the other side, but there
was nothing of any weight. The subject so occupied my
thoughts that I could attend to nothing else. I saw myself
called to be less than ever a man of this world, and
walked out with a heavy heart. Met Dr. F., who alone of
all men could best sympathise, and his few words were
encouraging. Yet I cannot cordially acquiesce in all the
Lord&rsquo;s dealings, though my reason and judgment approve
them, and my inclination would desire to do it. Dined at
Mr. Cecil&rsquo;s, where it providentially happened that Mr. Foster
came in. To them I read Mr. Simeon&rsquo;s letter, and they
were both convinced by it. So I went away home, with
nothing to do but to get my heart easy again under this
sacrifice. I devoted myself once more to the entire and
everlasting service of God, and found myself more weaned
from this world, and desiring the next, though not from a
right principle. Continued all the evening writing sermon,
and reading <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, with successions of vivid
emotions of pain and pleasure. My heart was sometimes
ready to break with agony at being torn from its dearest
idol, and at other times I was visited by a few moments of
sublime and enraptured joy. Such is the conflict; why
have my friends mentioned this subject? It has torn open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
old wounds, and I am again bleeding. With all my
honours and knowledge, the smiles and approbation of
men, the health and prosperity that have fallen to my lot,
together with that freedom from doubts and fears with
which I was formerly visited, how much have I gone
through in the last two or three years to bring my mind to
be willing to do the will of God when it should be revealed!
My heart is pained within me, and my bodily frame suffers
from it.</p>

<p><i>June 9.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;My heart is still pained. It is still
as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; the Lord help
me to maintain the conflict. Preached this morning at
Long Acre Chapel on Matt. xxviii., the three last verses.
There was the utmost attention. In the interval between
morning and afternoon, passed most of the time in reading
and prayer. Read Matthew iii., and considered the character
of John the Baptist. Holy emulation seemed to
spring up in my mind. Then read John xvii. and last chapter,
and Rev. i., all of which were blessed to my soul. I went
into the church persuaded in my feelings&mdash;which is different
from being persuaded in the understanding&mdash;that it
was nobler and wiser to be as John the Baptist, Peter, John,
and all the Apostles, than to have my own will gratified.
Preached on Eph. ii. 18. Walked a little with Mr. Grant
this evening. He told me I should have great trials and
temptations in India; but I know where to apply for grace
to help.</p></div>

<p>Cecil&rsquo;s final opinion, that Lydia Grenfell&rsquo;s decision
would fully declare the will of God, was not borne out by
the result, as we shall see. Meanwhile, let us trace the
steps which led to the final appointment to India, and
the farewell.</p>

<p>On his first visit to London at the beginning of the year
1804, by the Telegraph coach, the Cambridge recluse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
distracted by the bustle of the great city, as he walked
about the streets and called at the booksellers&rsquo;. Dr.
Wollaston, the British Museum, and the Gresham Lecture
on Music, of which he was passionately fond, occupied his
first two days. At the old India House, since swept away
from Leadenhall Street, he met Mr. Charles Grant, who,
as he took him to Clapham, the evangelical centre which
Sir James Stephen has made so famous,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> gave him much
information on the state of India, such as this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It would be absolutely necessary to keep three servants,
for three can do no more than the work of one English;
that no European constitution can endure being exposed
to mid-day heat; that Mr. Schwartz, who was settled at
Tanjore, did do it for a time, walking among the natives.
Mr. Grant had never seen Mr. Schwartz, but corresponded
with him. He was the son of a Saxon gentleman (the
Saxon gentlemen never enter the ministry of the Church),
and had early devoted himself to the work of a missionary
amongst the Indians. Besides the knowledge of the
Malabar tongue, in which he was profoundly skilled and
eloquent, he was a good classic, and learnt the English,
Portuguese, and Dutch. He was a man of dignified and
polished manners, and cheerful.</p></div>

<p>This was the first opportunity that &lsquo;the Clapham sect&rsquo;
had to satisfy themselves that the Senior Wrangler was
worthy of the commendation of Charles Simeon. Accordingly
they dined with William Wilberforce at Broomfield.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We conversed about my business. They wished me to
fill the church in Calcutta very much; but advised me to
wait some time, and to cherish the same views. To Mr.
Wilberforce I went into a detail of my views, and the
reasons that had operated on my mind. The conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of Mr. Wilberforce and Mr. Grant during the whole of the
day, before the rest of the company, which consisted of Mr.
Johnston, of New South Wales, a French Abbé, Mrs.
Unwin, Mr. H., and other ladies, was edifying; agreeable
to what I should think right for two godly senators, planning
some means of bringing before Parliament propositions
for bettering the moral state of the colony of Botany Bay.
At evening worship Mr. W. expounded Sacred Scripture
with serious plainness, and prayed in the midst of his large
household.</p></div>

<p>In <i>The Life of William Wilberforce</i>, by his sons, we
find this passage introduced by the remark, &lsquo;It is delightful
to contrast with his own language the observation of one
who, with as holy and as humble a soul, was just entering
on his brief but glorious course:&rsquo; Martyn &lsquo;drank tea at Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s; the old man was very civil to me, and striking
in his remarks in general.&rsquo; Next day:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Read Isaiah. At one, we went to hear the charge
delivered to the missionaries at the New London Tavern,
in Cheapside. There was nothing remarkable in it, but
the conclusion was affecting. I shook hands with the two
missionaries, Melchior Rayner and Peter Hartwig, and
almost wished to go with them, but certainly to go to
India. Returned, and read Isaiah.</p></div>

<p>From the ever recurring distractions of his soul, caused
now by &lsquo;a despicable indulgence in lying in bed,&rsquo; and again
by the interruptions of visitors, he sought refuge frequently
in fasting and ascetic self-denial, and occasionally in writing
verse:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Composed some poetry during my walk, which often
has a tendency to divert my thoughts from the base distractions
of this life, and to purify and elevate it to higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
subjects.... On my way to Mr. Simeon&rsquo;s, heard part of
the service in King&rsquo;s Chapel. The sanctity of the place,
and the music, brought heaven and eternal things, and the
presence of God, very near to me.</p></div>

<p>He seems to have competed for the Seatonian Prize.
He was an ardent lover of Nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Walked out before breakfast, and the beauties of the
opening spring constrained me to adoration and praise.
But no earthly object or operation can produce true
spirituality of heart. My present failing is in this, that I
do not feel the power of motives.</p></div>

<p>Of another walk he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was led to think a good while on my deficiency in
human learning, and on my having neglected those branches
which would have been pleasing and honourable in the
acquisition. Yet I said, though with somewhat of melancholy,
&lsquo;What things were gain to me, those I counted loss
for Christ.&rsquo; Though I become less esteemed by man, I
cannot but think (though it is not easy to do so) that it
must be more acceptable to God to labour for souls, though
the mind remains uninformed; and, consequently, that it
must be more truly great and noble, than to be great and
notable among men for learning. In the garden afterwards
I rejoiced exceedingly at the prospect of a death fast approaching,
when my powers of understanding would be
enlarged inconceivably. They all talked to me in praise
of my sermon on Sunday night; but praise is exceedingly
unpleasant to me, because I am slow to render back to
God that glory which belongs to Him alone. Sometimes
it may be useful in encouraging me, when I want encouragement;
but that at present is not the case; and in
truth, praise generally produces pride, and pride presently
sets me far from God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, what a snare are public ministrations to me! Not
that I wish for the praise of men, but there is some fear
and anxiety about not getting through. How happy could
I be in meeting the people of my God more frequently
were it not for this fear of being unprofitable! But since
God has given me natural gifts, let this teach me that all
I want is a spiritual frame to improve and employ them
in the things of God!</p>

<p>Mr. K. White, of Nottingham, breakfasted with me.
In my walk was greatly cast down, except for a short
time on my return, when, as I was singing, or rather
chanting, some petitions in a low, plaintive voice, I insensibly
found myself sweetly engaged in prayer.</p></div>

<p>Such outpourings of his heart must be read in the light
of a time when even the Churches had not awoke to their
duty, and the most theologically orthodox were too often
the most indifferent, or opposed, to the Lord&rsquo;s command.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1804, January 13.</i>&mdash;Walked out in the evening in great
tranquillity, and on my return met with Mr. C., with whom
I was obliged to walk an hour longer. He thought it a
most improper step for me to leave the University to preach
to the ignorant heathen, which any person could do, and
that I ought rather to improve the opportunity of acquiring
human learning. All our conversation on the subject of
learning, religion, &amp;c., ended in nothing; he was convinced
he was right, and all the texts of Scripture I produced were
applicable, according to him, only to the times of the
Apostles. How is my soul constrained to adore the sovereign
mercy of God, who began His work in my proud
heart, and carried it on through snares which have ruined
thousands&mdash;namely, human learning and honours: and now
my soul, dost thou not esteem all things but dung and
dross, compared with the excellency of the knowledge of
Christ Jesus my Lord? Yea, did not gratitude constrain me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
did not duty and fear of destruction, yet surely the excellency
of the service of Christ would constrain me to lay
down ten-thousand lives in the prosecution of it. My
heart was a little discomposed this evening at the account
of the late magnificent prizes proposed by Mr. Buchanan
and others in the University, for which Mr. C. has been
calling me to write; but I was soon at rest again. But
how easily do I forget that God is no respecter of persons;
that in the midst of the notice I attract as an enthusiast
He judges of me according to my inward state. Oh, my
soul, take no pleasure in outward religion, nor in exciting
wonder, but in the true circumcision of the heart.</p>

<p><i>January 16.</i>&mdash; <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> told me of many contemptuous insulting
things that had been said of me, reflecting, some on
my understanding, some on my condition, sincerity, inconsistent
conduct. It was a great trial of my patience, and I
was frequently tempted, in the course of the evening, to let
my natural spirit rage forth in indignation and revenge;
but I remembered Him of whom it was said, &lsquo;Who, when
He was reviled, reviled not again; but committed Himself
to Him that judgeth righteously.&rsquo; As I was conscious I
did not deserve the censures which were passed upon me,
I committed myself to God; and in Him may I abide until
the indignation be overpast!</p></div>

<p>In July 1804 he again visited London on his way to
Cornwall, and to see Mr. Charles Grant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dined with Mr. Wilberforce at Palace Yard. It was
very agreeable, as there was no one else. Speaking of the
slave trade, I mentioned the words, &lsquo;Shall I not visit for
these things?&rsquo; and found my heart so affected that I could
with difficulty refrain from tears. Went with Mr. W. to
the House of Commons, where I was surprised and charmed
with Mr. Pitt&rsquo;s eloquence. Ah, thought I, if these powers of
oratory were now employed in recommending the Gospel!</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>On his way back to Cambridge, through London, he</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Went to St. Paul&rsquo;s, to see Sir W. Jones&rsquo;s monument; the
sight of the interior of the dome filled my soul with inexpressible
ideas of the grandeur of God, and the glory of
heaven, much the same as I had at the sight of a painted
vaulted roof in the British Museum. I could scarcely
believe that I might be in the immediate enjoyments of
such glory in another hour. In the evening the sound of
sacred music, with the sight of a rural landscape, imparted
some indescribable emotions after the glory of God, by
diligence in His work. To preach the Gospel for the
salvation of my poor fellow-creatures, that they might
obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal
glory, seemed a very sweet and precious employment.
Lydia then, again, seemed a small hindrance.</p></div>

<p>His duties as examiner, tutor, and in charge of Lolworth,
and home mission work in Wall&rsquo;s Lane, the hospital and
almshouse, left him little leisure, and that he gave to the
Bengali grammars of Halhed and Carey, to Carey&rsquo;s Bengali
New Testament, to Arabic grammars, and to the missionary
accounts in the <i>Christian Observer</i>, for which, also, he wrote.
Referring, evidently, to Carey&rsquo;s convert, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The account of a Brahmin preaching the Gospel
delighted me most exceedingly. I could not help blessing
God for thus glorifying Himself.... I was much pained
and humbled at reflecting that it has never yet, to my
knowledge, pleased God to awaken one soul by my means,
either in public or private,&mdash;shame be to myself.</p>

<p>Simeon gave me a letter from Mr. Brown of Calcutta,
which gave me great delight on many accounts. Speaking
of me, he says, &lsquo;Let him marry, and come out at once.&rsquo; I
thought of Lydia with great tenderness, but without pain
at my determination to go out single. I found great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
affection in prayer for my dear brethren at Calcutta, for the
establishing of Christ&rsquo;s Kingdom among the poor Gentiles,
and for my being sent among them, if it were His will.</p>

<p>Thinking my mind was in need of recreation, I took up
Lord Teignmouth&rsquo;s <i>Life of Sir William Jones</i>, and read
till tea.</p>

<p>Low spirits at church, through being about to preach
old sermons, which I feel so ashamed of offering to God,
that I believe I shall rather leave everything undone, than
not write one new one at least every week.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomason preached on Heb. xii. to my edification.</p>

<p>Dr. Milner and Lord C. called. I was introduced as
having been Senior Wrangler; but how contemptible did
these paltry honours appear to me! Ah, thought I, you
know not how little I am flattered by these intended compliments.</p>

<p>In the hall was much affected by the sight of Lord B.,
whose look of meekness and humility riveted my attention,
and almost melted me to tears. If there is one disposition
in the world I wish for more than another, it is this;
but the bias of my corrupted nature hurries me violently
against it.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Grant&rsquo;s summons to him &lsquo;to sail for St. Helena in
eight or ten days,&rsquo; reached him a month before his twenty-fourth
birthday, before which he could not legally receive
full ordination, in the Chapel Royal at St. James&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Felt more persuaded of my call than ever; indeed,
there was scarcely a shadow of a doubt left. Rejoice, O
my soul, thou shalt be the servant of thy God in this life,
and then in the next for all the boundless ages of eternity.</p></div>

<p>Not till August 31 was it possible for the fleet which
convoyed the East Indiamen, in that year of war with
France and Napoleon&rsquo;s Continental allies, to see the last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Ireland. The seven months were spent by Henry Martyn
in elaborate preparations for what proved to be nearly a
year&rsquo;s voyage, and in repeated farewells the anguish of
which is reflected in his <i>Journal</i> and correspondence.
Having previously taken his M.A. degree, he received that
of Bachelor of Divinity by mandate, which required the
assent of all the heads of colleges, and then a grace to pass
the senate, and the presenting of a petition to the King.
Dr. Gilchrist, the Orientalist who had just returned from his
long career in Calcutta, where he had been a colleague of
Carey in the College of Fort William, gave him lessons
in Hindustani pronunciation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On my mentioning my desire of translating some of the
Scriptures with him, he advised me by all means to desist
till I knew much more of the language, by having resided
some years in the country. He said it was the rock on
which missions had split, that they had attempted to
write and preach before they knew the language. The
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, he said, was now a common subject of
ridicule with the people, on account of the manner in which
it had been translated. All these are useful hints to me.</p></div>

<p>The mode of appointing to Indian chaplaincies has
varied so much since the time of Charles Grant and
Simeon, that it is interesting to see what was done in
Henry Martyn&rsquo;s case.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1805, April 1.</i>&mdash;Went to Lord Hawkesbury&rsquo;s office, but,
being too early, I went into St. James&rsquo;s Park, and sat down
on a bench to read my Bible. After a little time a person
came and sat down on the same bench; on entering into
conversation with him I found he had known better days.
He was about seventy years of age, and of a very passionate
and disappointed spirit. He spoke sensibly on several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
subjects, and was acquainted with the Gospel; but
was offended at my reminding him of several things
concerning it. On my offering him some money, which I
saw he needed, he confessed his poverty; he was thankful
for my little donation, and I repeated my advice of seeking
divine consolation.</p>

<p><i>April 2.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted with <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>. Our conversation
was on the most delightful subject to me, the spread of the
Gospel in future ages. I went away animated and happy.
Went with Mr. Grant towards the India House. He
said that he was that day about to take the necessary steps
for bringing forward the business of the chaplains, and
that by to-morrow night I should know whether I could
go or not. In prayer at night my soul panted after
God, and longed to be entirely conformed to His image.</p>

<p><i>April 3.</i>&mdash;After dinner, passed some time in prayer, and
rejoiced to think that God would finally glorify Himself,
whatever hindrance may arise for a time. Going to
Mr. Grant&rsquo;s, I found that the chaplaincies had been agreed
to, after two hours&rsquo; debate, and some obloquy thrown upon
Mr. Grant by the chairman, for his connection with Mr.
Wilberforce and <i>those people</i>. Mr. G. said that though my
nomination had not taken place, the case was now beyond
danger, and that I should appear before the court in a
couple of days in my canonicals. I felt very indignant at
this, not so much, I think, from personal pride, as on
account of the degradation of my office. Mr. G. pleasantly
said, I must attend to my appearance, as I should be much
remarked, on account of the person who had nominated
me. I feel this will be a trial to me, which I would never
submit to for gain; but I rejoice that it will be for my
dear and blessed Lord.</p>

<p><i>April 4.</i>&mdash;Went down to Cambridge.</p>

<p><i>April 6.</i>&mdash;Passed most of the morning in the Fellows&rsquo;
garden. It was the last time I visited this favourite retreat,
where I have often enjoyed the presence of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><i>April 7.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached at Lolworth on Prov. xxii.
17; very few seemed affected at my leaving them, and those
chiefly women. An old farmer of a neighbouring parish,
as he was taking leave of me, turned aside to shed tears;
this affected me more than anything. Rode away with my
heart heavy, partly at my own corruption, partly at the
thoughts of leaving this place in such general hardness of
heart. Yet so it hath pleased God, I hope, to reserve them
for a more faithful minister. Prayed over the whole of my
sermon for the evening, and when I came to preach it, God
assisted me beyond my hopes. Most of the younger
people seemed to be in tears. The text was 2 Sam. vii.
28, 29. Took leave of Dr. Milner; he was much affected,
and said himself his heart was full. Mr. Simeon commended
me to God in prayer, in which he pleaded, amongst other
things, for a richer blessing on my soul. He perceives that
I want it, and so do I. Professor Parish walked home with
me to the college gate, and there I parted from him, with
no small sorrow.</p>

<p><i>April 8.</i>&mdash;My young friends in the University, who have
scarcely left me a moment to myself, were with me this
morning as soon as I was moving, leaving me no time for
prayer. My mind was very solemn, and I wished much to
be left alone. A great many accompanied me to the coach,
which took me up at the end of the town. It was a thick,
misty morning, so the University, with its towers and
spires, was out of sight in an instant.</p>

<p><i>April 24.</i>&mdash;Keenly disappointed at finding no letter
from Lydia; thus it pleased God, in the riches of His grace,
to quash at once all my beginnings of entanglement. Oh,
may it be to make me more entirely His own. &lsquo;The Lord
shall be the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup.&rsquo;
Oh, may I live indeed a more spiritual life of faith! Prayed
that I might obtain a more deep acquaintance with the
mysteries of the Gospel, and the offices of Christ; my soul
was solemnised. Went to Russell Square, and found from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Mr. Grant that I was that day appointed a chaplain to the
East India Company, but that my particular destination
would depend on the government in India. Rather may I
say that it depends on the will of my God, who in His
own time thus brings things to pass. Oh, now let my
heart be spiritualised; that the glorious and arduous work
before me may fill all my soul, and stir me up to prayer.</p>

<p><i>April 25.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted with the venerable Mr. Newton,
who made several striking remarks in reference to my
work. He said he had heard of a clever gardener, who
would sow the seeds when the meat was put down to
roast, and engage to produce a salad by the time it was
ready; but the Lord did not sow oaks in this way. On
my saying that perhaps I should never live to see much
fruit, he answered, I should have a bird&rsquo;s eye view of it,
which would be better. When I spoke of the opposition
that I should be likely to meet with, he said, he supposed
Satan would not love me for what I was about to do. The
old man prayed afterwards, with sweet simplicity. Drank
tea at C. Our hearts seemed full of the joy which comes
from the communion of saints.</p>

<p><i>April 26.</i>&mdash;Met D. at Mr. Grant&rsquo;s, and was much
affected at some marks of love expressed by the people
at Cambridge, at the time of my leaving them. He said
that as I was going down the aisle they all rose up to take
their last view.</p>

<p><i>May 4.</i>&mdash;Waiting this morning on the Archbishop of
Canterbury at Lambeth Palace. He had learnt from
somebody my circumstances, the degree I had taken, and
my object in going to India. He spoke much on the importance
of the work, the small ecclesiastical establishment
for so great a body of people, and the state of those
English there, who, he said, &lsquo;called themselves Christians.&rsquo;
He was throughout very civil, and wished me all the
success I desired. I then proceeded to the India House,
and received directions to attend on Wednesday to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sworn in. Afterwards walked to Mr. Wilberforce&rsquo;s at
Broomfield.</p>

<p><i>May 8.</i>&mdash;Reading Mr. Grant&rsquo;s book.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The state of the
natives, and the prospects of doing good there, the character
of Schwartz, &amp;c., set forth in it, much impressed my mind,
and I found great satisfaction in pleading for the fulfilment
of God&rsquo;s promises to the heathen. It seemed painful
to think of myself at all, except in reference to the Church
of Christ. Being somewhat in danger of distraction this
evening, from many concurrent circumstances, I found a
very short prayer answered by my being kept steady.
Heard from Mr. Parry this evening, that in consequence of
an embargo laid on all the ships by government, who had
taken the best seamen from the Company&rsquo;s ships, on account
of the sailing of the French and Spanish fleets, I should
not be able to go before the middle of June, if so soon.</p>

<p><i>May 15.</i>&mdash;Read prayers at Mr. Newton&rsquo;s, and preached
on Eph. ii. 19-21. The clerk threw out very disrespectful
and even uncivil things respecting my going to India;
though I thought the asperity and contemptuousness he
manifested unsuitable to his profession, I felt happy in the
comfortable assurance of being upright in my intentions.
The sermon was much praised by some people coming in,
but happily this gives me little satisfaction. Went home and
read a sermon of Flavel&rsquo;s, on knowing nothing but Christ.</p>

<p><i>May 17.</i>&mdash;Walked out, and continued in earnest striving
with my corruption. I made a covenant with my eyes,
which I kept strictly; though I was astonished to find the
difficulty I had in doing even this.</p>

<p><i>May 22.</i>&mdash;Endeavoured to guard my thoughts this
morning in a more particular manner, as expecting to pass
it, with Sargent, in prayer for assistance in the ministry.
Called at Mr. Wilberforce&rsquo;s, when I met Mr. Babington.
The extreme kindness and cordiality of these two was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
pleasing to me, though rather elating. By a letter from
B. to-day, learnt that two young men of Chesterton had
come forward, who professed to have been awakened by a
sermon of mine on Psalm ix. 17. I was not so affected
with gratitude and joy as I expected to be; could not
easily ascribe the glory to God; yet I will bless Him
through all my ignorance that He has thus owned the
ministry of one so weak. Oh, may I have faith to go onward,
expecting to see miracles wrought by the foolishness
of preaching. H., to whom I had made application for the
loan which Major Sandys found it inconvenient to advance,
dined with me, and surprised me by the difficulty he
started. After dinner went to the India House to take
leave. Mr. <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, the other chaplain, sat with me before
we were called in, and I found that I knew a little of him,
having been at his house. As he knew my character, I
spoke very freely to him on the subject of religion. Was
called in to take the oaths. All the directors were present,
I think. Mr. Grant, in the chair, addressed a charge to us,
extempore. One thing struck my attention, which was, that
he warned us of the enervating effects of the climate.</p>

<p>I felt more acutely than ever I did in my life the
shame attending poverty. Nothing but the remembrance
that I was not to blame supported me. Whatever comes
to me in the way of Providence is, and must be, for my
good.</p>

<p><i>May 30.</i>&mdash;Went to the India House. Kept the covenant
with my eyes pretty well. Oh, what bitter experience
have I had to teach me carefulness against temptation! I
have found this method, which I have sometimes had
recourse to, useful to-day&mdash;namely, that of praying in
ejaculations for any particular person whose appearance
might prove an occasion of sinful thoughts. After asking
of God that she might be as pure and beautiful in her
mind and heart as in body, and be a temple of the Holy
Ghost, consecrated to the service of God, for whose glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
she was made, I dare not harbour a thought of an opposite
tendency.</p>

<p><i>June 6.</i>&mdash;How many temptations are there in the streets
of London!</p>

<p><i>June 14.</i>&mdash;Sent off all my luggage, as preparatory to its
going on board. Dined at Mr. Cecil&rsquo;s; he endeavoured to
correct my reading, but in vain. &lsquo;Brother M.,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;you are a humble man, and would gain regard in private
life; but to gain public attention you must force yourself
into a more marked and expressive manner.&rsquo; Generally,
to-night, have I been above the world; Lydia, and other
comforts, I would resign.</p>

<p><i>June 16.</i>&mdash;I thought it probable, from illness, that death
might be at hand, and this was before me all the day;
sometimes I was exceedingly refreshed and comforted at
the thought, at other times I felt unwilling and afraid to
die. Shed tears at night, at the thought of my departure,
and the roaring sea, that would soon be rolling between
me and all that is dear to me upon earth.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. T.M. Hitchins, his cousin&rsquo;s wife, having asked
him for some of his sermons, he replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date">
London: June 24, 1805.<br />
</p>

<p>The arguments you offer to induce me seem not to
possess that force which I look for in your reasoning.
Sermons cannot be good memorials, because once read
they are done with&mdash;especially a young man&rsquo;s sermons,
unless they possess a peculiar simplicity and spirituality;
which I need not say are qualities not belonging to mine.
I hope, however, that I am improving and I trust that&mdash;now
I am removed from the contagion of academic air&mdash;I
am in the way of acquiring a greater knowledge of men
and of my own heart&mdash;I shall exchange my jejune scholastic
style for a simple spiritual exhibition of profitable truth.
Mr. Cecil has been taking a great deal of pains with me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
My insipid, inanimate manner in the pulpit, he says, is
intolerable. Sir, said he, it is cupola-painting, not miniature,
that must be the character of a man that harangues
a multitude. Lieut. Wynter called on me last Saturday,
and last night drank tea with me. I cannot but admire
his great seriousness. I feel greatly attached to him. He
is just the sort of person, of a sober thoughtful cast, that
I love to associate with. He mentioned Lydia, I do not
know why, but he could not tell me half enough about
her, while she was at Plymouth, to satisfy my curiosity.
Whitsun-week was a time of the utmost distress to me on
her account. On the Monday at the Eclectic, Mr. Cecil,
speaking of celibacy, said, I was acting like a madman in
going out without a wife. So thought all the other ten or
eleven ministers present, and Mr. Foster among the rest,
who is unmarried. This opinion, coming deliberately from
so many experienced ministers, threw me into great
perplexity, which increased, as my affections began to be
set more afloat, for then I was less able than before to
discern the path of duty. At last I wrote to Simeon,
stating to him the strongest arguments I heard in favour
of marriage in my case. His answer decided my mind.
He put it in this way. Is it necessary? To this I could
answer, No. Then is it expedient? He here produced so
many weighty reasons against its expediency, that I was
soon satisfied in my mind. My turbulent will was, however,
not so easily pacified. I was again obliged to undergo the
severest pain in making that sacrifice which had cost me
so dear before. Better had it been if those wounds had
never been torn open. But now again, through the mercy
of God, I am once more at peace. What cannot His power
effect? The present wish of my heart is that there may
be <i>never</i> a necessity of marriage, so that I may henceforth
have no one thing upon earth for which I would wish to
stay another hour, except it be to serve the Lord my
Saviour in the work of the ministry. Once more, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
I say to Lydia, and with her to all earthly schemes of
happiness, Farewell. Let her live happy and useful in her
present situation, since that is the will of God. How long
these thoughts may continue, I cannot say. At times of
indolence, or distress, or prevalent corruption, the former
wishes, I suppose, will occur and renew my pain: but pray,
my dear sister, that the Lord may keep in the imaginations
of the thoughts of my heart all that may be for the glory
of His great name. The only objection which presented
itself to my advisers to marriage was the difficulty of
finding a proper person to be the wife of a missionary. I
told them that perhaps I should not have occasion to search
a long time for one. Simeon knows all about Lydia. I
think it very likely that he will endeavour to see her when
she comes to town next winter.</p>

<p>(<i>Addendum at the commencement, before the Address.</i>)</p>

<p>I never returned my acknowledgment for the little
hymn book, which is a memento of both. It is just the
sort of thing. Instead of sending the books I intended, I
shall inclose in the tea-caddy a little <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>
for you, and another for Lydia.</p></div>

<p>July 2 was spent with Corrie in prayer, and converse
&lsquo;about the great work among the heathen.&rsquo; Martyn gave
a final sitting for his miniature for his sister, to &lsquo;the
painter lady, who still repeated her infidel cavils; having
nothing more to say in the way of argument, I thought it
right to declare the threatenings of God to those who
reject the Gospel.&rsquo; On the 8th he sat for his picture, for
his friend Bates, to Russel. After his farewell to Sargent,
and riding back,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Though I was in good health a moment before, yet as
I was undressing I fainted and fell into a convulsive fit; I
lost my senses for some time, and on recovering a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
found myself in intense pain. Death appeared near at
hand, and seemed somewhat different and more terrible
than I could have conceived before, not in its conclusion,
but in itself. I felt assured of my safety in Christ. Slept
very little that night, from extreme debility. Tenth, I
went to Portsmouth, where we arrived to breakfast, and
find friends from Cambridge. Went with my things on
board the Union at the Motherbank. Mr. Simeon read
and prayed in the afternoon, thinking I was to go on board
for the last time. Mr. Simeon first prayed, and then myself.
On our way to the ship we sung hymns. The time
was exceedingly solemn, and our hearts seemed filled with
solemn joy.</p></div>

<p>As tidings from Lord Nelson were waited for, the fleet&mdash;consisting
of fifteen sail under convoy of the Belliqueuse,
Captain Byng&mdash;went no farther than Plymouth, and then
anchored off Falmouth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The coast of Devonshire and Cornwall was passing
before me. The memory of beloved friends, then, was very
strong and affecting.... I was rather flurried at the singularity
of this providence of God, in thus leading me once
more to the bosom of all my friends.... I have thought with
exceeding tenderness of Lydia to-day; how I long to see
her; but if it be the Lord&rsquo;s will, He will open a way. I
shall not take any steps to produce a meeting.</p></div>

<p>So he wrote on July 20. On the same day, the Rev.
T.M. Hitchins wrote to him, thus: &lsquo;Lydia, from whom we
heard about ten days ago, is quite well. She is much
interested in your welfare.&rsquo; Mrs. Hitchins wrote: &lsquo;Lydia,
whom I heard lately from, is well, and never omits
mentioning you in her letters&mdash;and, I may venture to say,
what you will value still more, in her prayers also.&rsquo; Martyn
wrote to Mr. Hitchins on the 23rd:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> &lsquo;A great work lies
before me, and I must submit to many privations if I
would see it accomplished. I should say, however, that
poverty is not one of the evils I shall have to encounter;
the salary of a chaplain, even at the lowest, is 600 rupees
a month. Give my kind love to mama&mdash;as also to Miss
L. Grenfell.&rsquo; A postscript to the letter stated that the
writer had taken his place in the coach for Marazion:
&lsquo;Trust to pass some part of the morning at Miss Grenfell&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
He thus records in his <i>Journal</i> the interviews which
resulted in what amounted to a brief engagement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I arrived at Marazion in time for breakfast, and met
my beloved Lydia. In the course of the morning I walked
with her, though not uninterruptedly; with much confusion
I declared my affection for her, with the intention
of learning whether, if ever I saw it right in India to be
married, she would come out; but she would not declare
her sentiments, she said that the shortness of arrangement
was an obstacle, even if all others were removed. In great
tumult I walked up to St. Hilary, whence, after dining, I
returned to Mr. Grenfell&rsquo;s, but, on account of the number
of persons there, I had not an opportunity of being alone
with Lydia. Went back to Falmouth with G. I was
more disposed to talk of Lydia all the way, but roused
myself to a sense of my duty, and addressed him on the subject
of religion. The next day I was exceedingly melancholy
at what had taken place between Lydia and myself,
and at the thought of being separated from her. I could
not bring myself to believe that God had settled the whole
matter, because I was not willing to believe it.</p>

Union, Falmouth Harbour: July 27, 1805.<br />
</p>

<p>... As I was coming on board this morning, and
reading Mr. Serle&rsquo;s hymn you wrote out for me, a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
gust of wind blew it into the sea. I made the boatmen
immediately heave to, and recovered it, happily without
any injury except what it had received from the sea.
I should have told you that the Morning Hymn, which I
always kept carefully in my pocket-book, was one day
stolen with it, and other valuable letters, from my rooms
in college. It would be extremely gratifying to me to
possess another copy of it, as it always reminded me most
forcibly of the happy day on which we visited the aged
saint. The fleet, it is said, will not sail for three weeks,
but if you are willing to employ any of your time in providing
me with this or any other manuscript hymns, the
sooner you write them, the more certain I shall be of
receiving them. Pardon me for thus intruding on your
time; you will in no wise lose your reward. The
encouragement conveyed in little compositions of this sort
is more refreshing than a cup of cold water. The Lord of
the harvest, who is sending forth me, who am most truly
less than the least of all saints, will reward you for being
willing to help forward even the meanest of His servants.
The love which you bear to the cause of Christ, as well as
motives of private friendship, will, I trust, induce you to
commend me to God, and to the word of His grace, at
those sacred moments when you approach the throne of
our covenant God. To His gracious care I commend you.
May you long live happy and holy, daily growing more
meet for the inheritance of the saints in light. I remain,
with affectionate regard, yours most truly,</p>

<p><i>July 28.</i>&mdash;(Sunday.)&mdash;Preached in the morning, on
board, on John iii. 3. In the afternoon, at Falmouth Church,
on 1 Cor. i. 20 to 26.</p>

<p><i>July 29.</i>&mdash;My gloom returned. Walked to Lamorran;
alternately repining at my dispensation, and giving it up
to the Lord. Sometimes&mdash;after thinking of Lydia for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
long time together, so as to feel almost outrageous at being
deprived of her&mdash;my soul would feel its guilt, and flee again
to God. I was much relieved at intervals by learning the
hymn, &lsquo;The God of Abraham praise.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>The lady&rsquo;s <i>Diary</i> has these passages, which show that
her sister, Mrs. Hitchins, had rightly represented the state
of her heart as not altogether refusing to return Martyn&rsquo;s
affection:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1805, July 25.</i>&mdash;I was surprised this morning by a visit
from H.M., and have passed the day chiefly with him.
The distance he is going, and the errand he is going on,
rendered his society particularly interesting. I felt as if
bidding a final adieu to him in this world, and all he said
was as the words of one on the borders of eternity. May
I improve the opportunity I have enjoyed of Christian
converse, and may the Lord moderate the sorrow I feel at
parting with so valuable and excellent friend&mdash;some pains
have attended it, known only to God and myself. Thou
God, that knowest them, canst alone give comfort....
Oh, may we each pursue our different paths, and meet at
last around our Father&rsquo;s throne; may we often meet now
in spirit, praying and obtaining blessings for each other.
Now, my soul, return to God, the author of them.</p>

<p><i>July 26.</i>&mdash;Oh, how this day has passed away! Nothing
done to any good purpose. Lord, help me! I feel Thy
loved presence withdrawn; I feel departing from Thee.
Oh, let Thy mercy pardon, let Thy love succour, me.
Deliver me from this temptation, set my soul at liberty,
and I will praise Thee. I know the cause of all this
darkness, this depression; dare I desire what Thou dost
plainly, by the voice of Thy providence, condemn? O
Lord, help me to conquer my natural feelings, help me to
be watchful as Thy child. Oh, leave me not; or I fall a
prey to this corroding care. Let me cast every care on Thee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gurlyn, July 30.</i>&mdash;Blessed Lord, I thank Thee for
affording me the retirement I so much delight in; here I
enjoy freedom from all the noise and interruption of a
town. Oh, may the Lord sanctify this pleasure. Oh, may it
prove the means of benefiting my soul. Oh, may I watch
against the intrusions of vain thoughts; else, instead of an
advantage, I shall find solitude ruinous to my soul.</p>

<p><i>August 4.</i>&mdash;This evening my soul has been pained with
many fears concerning an absent friend, yet the Lord
sweetly supports me, and is truly a refuge to me. It is a
stormy and tempestuous night; the stillness and retirement
of this place add to the solemnity of the hour. I hear
the voice of God in every blast&mdash;it seems to say, &lsquo;Sin has
brought storm and tempest on a guilty world.&rsquo; O my
Father and my God, Thou art righteous in all Thy
judgments, merciful in all Thy ways. I would humbly
trust in Thee, and confide all who are dear to me into
Thy hands. The anxieties of nature, the apprehensions
of affection, do Thou regulate, and make me acquiesce in
whatever is Thy will.</p>

<p><i>August 5.</i>&mdash;My mind is relieved to-day by hearing the
fleet, in which I thought my friend had sailed, has not left
the port. Oh, how frequently do unnecessary pains destroy
our peace. Lord, look on me to-night, pardon my sins
and make me more watchful and fight against my inward
corruption. Oh, it is a state of conflict indeed!</p></div>

<p>He thus wrote to Mrs. Hitchins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date">
Falmouth: July 30, 1805.<br />
</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dearest Cousin,&mdash;I am exceedingly rejoiced at
being permitted to send you one more letter, as the former,
if it had been the last, would have left, I fear, a painful
impression on your mind. It pleased God to restore peace
to my mind soon after I came on board&mdash;as I thought&mdash;finally.
I was left more alone with God, and found blessed
seasons of intercourse with Him. But when your letter came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
I found it so sympathising, so affectionate, that my heart was
filled with joy and thankfulness to God for such a dear
friend, and I could not refrain from bowing my knees immediately
to pray that God might bless all your words to
the good of my soul, and bless you for having written them.
My views of the respective importance of things continue,
I hope, to rectify. The shortness of time, the precious
value of immortal souls, and the plain command of Christ,
all conspire to teach me that Lydia must be resigned&mdash;and
for ever&mdash;for though you suggest the possibility of my
hereafter returning and being united to her, I rather wish
to beware of looking forward to anything in this life as the
end or reward of my labours. It would be a temptation to
me to return before being necessitated. The rest which
remaineth for the people of God is in another world, where
they neither marry nor are given in marriage. But while
I thus reason, still a sigh will ever and anon escape me at
the thought of a final separation from her. In the morning
when I rise, before prayer puts grace into exercise, there is
generally a very heavy gloom on my spirits&mdash;and a distaste
for everything in earth or heaven. You do not seem to
suppose that any objection would remain in her mind, if I
should return and other obstacles were removed&mdash;which
opinion of yours is, no doubt, very pleasing to me&mdash;but if
there <i>were</i> anything more than friendship, do you think it
at all likely she could have spoken and written to me as she
has? However, do not suppose from this that I wish to
hear from you anything more on this subject&mdash;in the hope
of being gratified with an assurance to the contrary. I
cannot tell what induced me to take my leave of the people
in the west when I was last there, as it was so probable we
should be detained; were it not for having bid them adieu,
I believe I should pay them another visit&mdash;only that I
could not do it without being with Lydia again, which
might not perhaps answer any good purpose, and more
probably would renew the pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>If, in India, I should be persuaded of the expediency of
marriage, you perceive that I can do nothing less than
make her the offer, or rather propose the sacrifice. It
would be almost cruel and presumptuous in me to make
such an application to her, especially as she would be
induced by a sense of duty rather than personal attachment.
But what else can be done? Should she not, then,
be warned of my intention&mdash;before I go? If you advance
no objection, I shall write a letter to her, notwithstanding
her prohibition. When this is done no further step remains
to be taken, that I know of. The shortness of our acquaintance,
which she made a ground of objection, cannot
now be remedied.</p>

<p>The matter, as it stands, must be left with God&mdash;and I
do leave it with Him very cheerfully. I pray that hereafter
I may not be tempted to follow my will, and mistake it for
God&rsquo;s&mdash;to fancy I am called to marriage, when I ought to
remain single&mdash;and you will likewise pray, my dear cousin,
that my mind may be always under a right direction.</p></div>

<p>His <i>Journal</i> thus continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>July 31.</i>&mdash;Went on board this morning in extreme
anguish. I could not help saying, &lsquo;Lord, it is not a sinful
attachment in itself, and therefore I may commune more
freely with Thee about it.&rsquo; I sought for hymns suitable
to my case, but none did sufficiently; most complained of
spiritual distress, but mine was not from any doubt of God&rsquo;s
favour, for I felt no doubt of that.</p>

<p><i>August 1.</i>&mdash;Rose in great anguish of mind, but prayer
relieved me a little. The wind continuing foul, I went
ashore after breakfast; but before this, sat down to write
to Lydia, hoping to relieve the burden of my mind. I
wrote in great turbulence, but in a little time my tumult
unaccountably subsided, and I enjoyed a peace to which I
have been for some time a stranger. I felt exceedingly
willing to leave her, and to go on my way rejoicing. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
could not account for this, except by ascribing it to the
gracious influence of God. The first few Psalms were
exceedingly comfortable to me. Received a letter this
evening from Emma, and received it as from God; I was
animated before, but this added tenfold encouragement.
She warned me, from experience, of the carefulness it
would bring upon me; but spoke with such sympathy and
tenderness, that my heart was quite refreshed. I bowed my
knees to bless and adore God for it, and devoted myself anew
to His beloved service. Went on board at night; the sea
ran high, but I felt a sweet tranquillity in Him who stilleth
the raging of the sea. I was delighted to find that the
Lascars understood me perfectly when I spoke to them
a sentence or two in Hindustani.</p>

<p><i>August 5.</i>&mdash;Went ashore. Walked to Pendennis garrison;
enjoyed some happy reflections as I sat on one of
the ramparts, looking at the ships and sea.</p>

<p><i>August 7.</i>&mdash;Preached at Falmouth Church, on Psalm
iii. 1, with much comfort; after church, set off to walk to
St. Hilary. Reached Helston in three hours in extraordinary
spirits. The joy of my soul was very great. Every
object around me called forth praise and gratitude to God.
Perhaps it might have been joy at the prospect of seeing
Lydia, but I asked myself at the time, whether out of love
to God I was willing to turn back and see her no more.
I persuaded myself that I could. But perhaps had I been
put to the trial, it would have been otherwise. I arrived
safe at St. Hilary, and passed the evening agreeably
with R. 8th. Enjoyed much of the presence of God in
morning prayer. The morning passed profitably in writing
on Heb. ii. 3. My soul seemed to breathe seriously
after God. Walked down with R. to Gurlyn to call on
Lydia. She was not at home when we called, so I walked
out to meet her. When I met her coming up the hill, I
was almost induced to believe her more interested about
me than I had conceived. Went away in the expectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of visiting her frequently. Called on my way (from Falmouth)
at Gurlyn. My mind not in peace; at night in
prayer, my soul was much overwhelmed with fear, which
caused me to approach God in fervent petition, that He
would make me perfectly upright, and my walk consistent
with the high character I am called to assume.</p>

<p><i>August 10.</i>&mdash;Rose very early, with uneasiness increased
by seeing the wind northerly; walked away at seven to
Gurlyn, feeling little or no pleasure at the thought of
seeing Lydia; apprehension about the sailing of the fleet
made me dreadfully uneasy; was with Lydia a short time
before breakfast; afterwards I read the 10th Psalm, with
Horne&rsquo;s Commentary, to her and her mother; she was
then just putting into my hand the 10th of Genesis to read
when a servant came in, and said a horse was come for me
from St. Hilary, where a carriage was waiting to convey
me to Falmouth. All my painful presentiments were thus
realised, and it came upon me like a thunderbolt. Lydia
was evidently painfully affected by it; she came out, that
we might be alone at taking leave, and I then told her,
that if it should appear to be God&rsquo;s will that I should be
married, she must not be offended at receiving a letter from
me. In the great hurry she discovered more of her mind
than she intended; she made no objection whatever to
coming out. Thinking, perhaps, I wished to make an
engagement with her, she said we had better go quite free;
with this I left her, not knowing yet for what purpose I
have been permitted, by an unexpected providence, to enjoy
these interviews. I galloped back to St. Hilary, and
instantly got into a chaise with Mr. R., who had been awaked
by the signal gun at five in the morning, and had come for
me. At Hildon I got a horse, with which I rode to Falmouth,
meeting on the road another express sent after me
by R. I arrived about twelve, and instantly went on
board; almost all the other ships were under weigh, but the
Union had got entangled in the chains. The commodore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
expressed his anger as he passed, at this delay, but I
blessed the Lord, who had thus saved His poor creature
from shame and trouble. How delusive are schemes of
pleasure; at nine in the morning I was sitting at ease, with
the person dearest to me on earth, intending to go out with
her afterwards to see the different views, to visit some
persons with her, and to preach on the morrow; four hours
only elapsed, and I was under sail from England! The
anxiety to get on board, and the joy I felt at not being left
behind, absorbed other sorrowful considerations for a time;
wrote several letters as soon as I was on board. When I
was left a little at leisure, my spirits began to sink; yet
how backward was I to draw near to my God. I found
relief occasionally, yet still was slow to fly to this refuge
of my weary soul. Was meditating on a subject for
to-morrow. As more of the land gradually appeared behind
the Lizard, I watched with my spy-glass for the Mount
(St. Michael&rsquo;s), but in consequence of lying to for the purser,
and thus dropping astern of the fleet, night came on before
we weathered the point. Oh, let not my soul be deceived
and distracted by these foolish vanities, but now that I am
actually embarked in Christ&rsquo;s cause, let a peculiar unction
rest upon my soul, to wean me from the world, and to
inspire me with ardent zeal for the good of souls.</p>

<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Miss Lydia Grenfell</span></p>
<p  class="date">
Union, Falmouth: August 10, 1805.
</p>

<p>My dear Miss Lydia,&mdash;It will perhaps be some satisfaction
to yourself and your mother, to know that I was in
time. Our ship was entangled in the chain, and was by
that means the only one not under weigh when I arrived.
It seems that most of the people on board had given me up,
and did not mean to wait for me. I cannot but feel sensibly
this instance of Divine mercy in thus preserving me from
the great trouble that would have attended the loss of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
passage. Mount&rsquo;s Bay will soon be in sight, and recall
you all once more to my affectionate remembrance.... I
bid you a long Farewell. God ever bless you, and help
you sometimes to intercede for me.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">H. Martyn.</span>
</p></div>

<p>The lady alludes thus, in her <i>Diary</i>, to these events, in
language which confesses her love, as she did not again
confess it till after his death:<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>August 8.</i>&mdash;I was surprised again to-day by a visit from
my friend, Mr. Martyn, who, contrary to every expectation,
is detained, perhaps weeks longer. I feel myself called on
to act decisively&mdash;oh how difficult and painful a part&mdash;Lord,
assist me. I desire to be directed by Thy wisdom, and to
follow implicitly what appears Thy will. May we each
consider Thy honour as entrusted to us, and resolve, whatever
it may cost us, to seek Thy glory and do Thy will.
O Lord, I feel myself so weak that I would fain fly from
the trial. My hope is in Thee&mdash;do Thou strengthen me,
help me to seek, to know, and resolutely to do, Thy will,
and that we may be each divinely influenced, and may
principle be victorious over feeling. Thou, blessed Spirit,
aid, support, and guide us. Now may we be in the armour
of God, now may we flee from temptation. O blessed Jesus,
leave me not, forsake me not.</p>

<p><i>August 9.</i>&mdash;What a day of conflict has this been! I
was much blessed, as if to prepare me for it, in the morning,
and expected to see my friend, and hoped to have acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with Christian resolution. At Tregembo I learnt he had
been called on by express last night. The effect this
intelligence had on me shows how much my affections are
engaged. O Lord, I lament it, I wonder at myself, I
tremble at what may be before me&mdash;but do not, O Lord,
forsake me. The idea of his going, when at parting I
behaved with greater coolness and reserve than I ever did
before, was a distress I could hardly bear, and I prayed
the Lord to afford me an opportunity of doing away the
impression from his mind. I saw no possibility of this&mdash;imagining
the fleet must have sailed&mdash;when, to my
astonishment, I learnt from our servant that he had called
again this evening, and left a message that he would be
here to-morrow. Oh, I feel less able than ever to conceal
my real sentiments, and the necessity of doing it does not
so much weigh with me. O my soul, pause, reflect&mdash;thy
future happiness, and his too, the glory of God, the peace
of my dear mother&mdash;all are concerned in what may pass
to-morrow; I can only look and pray to be directed
aright.</p>

<p><i>August 10.</i>&mdash;Much have I to testify of supporting grace
this day, and of what I must consider Divine interference
in my favour, and that of my dear friend, who is now gone
to return no more. My affections are engaged past recalling,
and the anguish I endured yesterday, from an
apprehension that I had treated him with coolness, exceeds
my power to express; but God saw it, and kindly ordered
it that he should come and do away the idea from my
mind. It contributed likewise to my peace, and I hope to
his, that it is clearly now understood between us that he
is free to marry where he is going, and I have felt quite
resigned to the will of God in this, and shall often pray the
Lord to find him a suitable partner.</p>

<p>Went to meeting in a comfortable frame, but the
intelligence brought me there&mdash;that the fleet had probably
sailed without my friend&mdash;so distressed and distracted my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
mind, that I would gladly have exchanged my feelings of
yesterday for those I was now exercised with; yet in
prayer I found relief, and in appealing to God. How
unsought by me was his coming here. I still felt anxiety
beyond all expression to hear if he arrived in time or not.
Oh, not for all the world could offer me would I he should
lose his passage!&mdash;yet stay, my soul, recollect thyself, are
not all events at the Lord&rsquo;s disposal? Are not the steps
of a good man ordered by the Lord? Cast then this
burden on Him who carest for thee, my soul. Oh, let not
Thy name, great God, be blasphemed through us&mdash;surely
we desire to glorify it above all things, and would sacrifice
everything to do so; enter then my mind this night, and
let me in every dark providence trust in the Lord.</p>

<p><i>August 11.</i>&mdash;A day of singular mercies. O my soul,
how should the increasing goodness of God engage thee to
serve Him with more zeal and ardour. I had a comfortable
season in prayer before breakfast, enjoying sweet liberty of
spirit before God my Saviour, God, the sinner&rsquo;s friend and
helper. Went to church, but could get no comfort from
the sermon; the service I found in some parts quickening.
On my return I found a letter from my excellent friend,
dated on board the Union. Oh, what a relief to my
mind! By a singular providence this ship was prevented
sailing by getting entangled in the chain; every other
belonging to the fleet was under weigh when he reached
Falmouth, and his friends there had given over the hope of
his arriving in time. Doth not God care for His people,
and order everything, even the most trifling, that concerns
them? The fleet must not sail till the man of God joined
it;&mdash;praised be the name of the Lord for this instance of
His watchful care. And now, my soul, turn to God, thy
rest. Oh, may the remembrance of my dear friend, whilst
it is cherished as it ought, be no hindrance to my progress
in grace and holiness. May God alone fill my thoughts,
and may my regard for my friend be sanctified, and be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
means of stimulating me to press forward, and animate me
in devoting myself entirely to God. Lord, I would unfeignedly
adore Thee for all the instances of Thy loving
kindness to me this week. I have had many remarkable
answers to prayer, many proofs that the Lord watches
over me, unworthy as I am. O Divine Saviour, how shall
I praise Thee? Walked this evening to a little meeting at
Thirton Wood. I was greatly refreshed and comforted. Oh,
what a support in time of trouble is the Lord God of
Israel! I am about retiring to rest&mdash;oh, may my thoughts
upon my bed be solemn and spiritual. The remembrance
of my dear friend is at times attended with feelings most
painful, and yet, when I consider why he is gone, and
Whom he is serving, every burden is removed, and I rejoice
on his account, and rejoice that the Lord has such a faithful
servant employed in the work. Oh, may I find grace
triumphant over every feeling of my heart. Come, Lord
Jesus, and dwell with me.</p>

<p><i>August 12.</i>&mdash;Passed a sweet, peaceful day, enjoying much
of His presence whose favour giveth life, and joy, and peace.
Visited several of the poor near me, and found ability to
speak freely and feelingly to them of the state of their souls.
My dear absent friend is constantly remembered by me,
but I find not his remembrance a hindrance to my soul in
following after God&mdash;no, rather does it stimulate me in my
course. Thus hath the Lord answered my prayers, as it
respects myself, that our regard might be a sanctified one.
Oh, bless the Lord, my soul, for ever! praise Him in cheerful
lays from day to day, and hope eternally to do so.</p>

<p><i>August 13.</i>&mdash;Awoke early and had a happy season.
Visited a poor old man in great poverty, whose mind
seemed disposed to receive instruction, and in some measure
enlightened to know his sinful state and need of Christ; I
found it a good time whilst with him. This evening my
spirits are depressed; my absent friend is present to my
remembrance, possessing more than common sensibility and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
affection. What must his sufferings be? but God is sufficient
for him. He that careth for the falling sparrow will not
forget him&mdash;this is my never-failing source of consolation.</p>

<p><i>August 15.</i>&mdash;My soul has been cold in duties to-day.
Oh, for the spirit of devotion! Great are the things God
has wrought for me; oh, let these great things suitably impress
my soul. I have had many painful reflections to-day
respecting my absent friend, fearing whether I may not be
the occasion of much sorrow to him and possibly of
hindering him in the work. I could not do such violence
to my feelings as to treat him with reserve and distance,
yet, in his circumstances, I think I ought to. O Lord, if
in this I have offended, forgive me, and oh, do away
from his mind every improper remembrance of me. Help
me to cast my cares on Thee to-night, and help me with
peace.</p>

<p><i>Marazion, September 2.</i>&mdash;My mind has been exercised
with many painful anxieties about my dear friend, but I
have poured out my soul to God, and am relieved; I have
left my sorrows with Him. Isaiah (41st chapter) has
comforted me. Oh, what pleasure did that permission give
me when my heart was overburdened to-day. &lsquo;Produce
your cause&rsquo;&mdash;what a privilege to come to God as a friend.
I disclose those feelings to Him I have no power to any
earthly friend. Those I could say most to seem to avoid
the subject that occupies my mind; I have been wounded
by their silence, yet I do not imagine them indifferent or
unconcerned. It is well for me they have seemed to be so,
for it has made me more frequent at a throne of grace, and
brought me more acquainted with God as a friend who
will hear all my complaints. Oh, how sweet to approach
Him, through Christ, as my God. &lsquo;Fear not,&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;for
I am with you: be not dismayed, I am thy God, I will
strengthen thee, yea (O blessed assurance!) I will help
thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of My
righteousness;&rsquo; and so I find it&mdash;glory be to God! Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
hear the frequent prayers I offer for Thy dear servant,
sanctify our mutual regard; may it continue through eternity,
flowing from our love to Thee.</p>

<p><i>September 3.</i>&mdash;Still no letters from Stoke, and no
intelligence whether the fleet has sailed&mdash;this is no small
exercise of my patience, but at times I feel a sweet
complacency in saying, &lsquo;Thou art my portion, O Lord.&rsquo; I
have often felt happy in saying this, but it is in a season
such as this, when creature comforts fail, that we may know
whether we are sincere in saying so. Ah! how do we
imperceptibly cleave to earth, and how soon withdraw
our affections from God. I am sensible mine would never
fix on Him but by His own power effecting it. I rest on
Thy power, O God most high, retired from human observation.</p></div>

<p>When the commodore opened his sealed despatches off
the Lizard, it was found that the fleet was to linger still
longer at Cork, whence Henry Martyn wrote again to
Lydia&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Hitchins. On Sunday, when becalmed
in Mount&rsquo;s Bay, and he would have given anything to have
been ashore preaching at Marazion or St. Hilary, he had
taken for his text Hebrews xi. 16: &lsquo;But now they desire
a better country, that is, an heavenly.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Cork Harbour: August 19, 1805.<br />
</p>

<p>The beloved objects were still in sight, and Lydia I
knew was about that time at St. Hilary, but every wave
bore me farther and farther from them. I introduced what
I had to say by observing that we had now bid adieu to
England, and its shores were dying away from the view.
The female part of my audience were much affected, but I
do not know that any were induced to seek the better
country. The Mount continued in sight till five o&rsquo;clock,
when it disappeared behind the western boundary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
bay. Amidst the extreme gloom of my mind this day I
found great comfort in interceding earnestly for my beloved
friends all over England. If you have heard from Marazion
since Sunday, I should be curious to know whether the fleet
was observed passing....</p>

<p>We are now in the midst of a vast number of transports
filled with troops. It is now certain from our coming here
that we are to join in some expedition, probably the Cape
of Good Hope, or the Brazils; anywhere for me so long as
the Lord goes with me. If it should please God to send
me another letter from you, which I scarcely dare hope, do
not forget to tell me as much as you can about Lydia. I
cannot write to her, or I should find the greatest relief and
pleasure even in transmitting upon paper the assurances of
my tenderest love.</p>
<hr class="shorthr" />
<p class="date">
Cove of Cork: August 28, 1805.<br />
</p>

<p>My dearest Cousin,&mdash;I have but a few minutes to
say that we are again going to sea&mdash;under convoy of five
men of war. Very anxiously have I been expecting to
receive an answer to the letter I sent you on my arrival
at this port, bearing date August 16; from the manner in
which I had it conveyed to the post-office, I begin to fear
it has never reached you. I have this instant received the
letter you wrote me the day on which we sailed from
Falmouth. Everything from you gives me the greatest
pleasure, but this letter has rather tended to excite
sentiments of pain as well as pleasure. I fear my proceedings
have met with your disapprobation, and have
therefore been wrong&mdash;since it is more probable you should
judge impartially than myself.</p>

<p>I am now fully of opinion that, were I convinced of
the expediency of marriage, I ought not in conscience to
propose it, while the obstacle of S.J. remains. Whatever
others have said, I think that Lydia acts no more than
consistently by persevering in her present determination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
I confess, therefore, that till this obstacle is removed my
path is perfectly clear, and, blessed be God! I feel very,
very happy in all that my God shall order concerning me.
Let me suffer privation, and sorrow and death, if I may by
these tribulations enter into the kingdom of God. Since we
have been lying here I have been enjoying a peace almost
uninterrupted. The Spirit of adoption has been drawing
me near to God, and giving me the full assurance of His
love. My prayer is continually that I may be more deeply
and habitually convinced of His unchanging, everlasting
love, and that my whole soul may be altogether in Christ.
The Lord teaches me to desire Christ for my all in all&mdash;to
long to be encircled in His everlasting arms, to be
swallowed up in the fulness of His love. Surely the soul
is happy that thus bathes in a medium of love. I wish no
created good, but to be one with Him and to be living for my
Saviour and Lord. Oh, may it be my constant care to live
free from the spirit of bondage, and at all times have access
to the Father. This I now feel, my beloved cousin, should
be our state&mdash;perfect reconciliation with God, perfect
appropriation of Him in all His endearing attributes,
according to all that He has promised. This shall bear us
safely through the storm. Oh, how happy are we in being
introduced to such high privileges! You and my dear
brother, and Lydia, I rejoice to think, are often praying
for me and interested about me. I have, of course, much
more time and leisure to intercede for you than you for
me&mdash;and you may be assured I do not fail to employ
my superior opportunities in your behalf. Especially is it
my prayer that the mind of my dear cousin, formed as
it is by nature and by grace for higher occupations, may
not be rendered uneasy by the employments and cares
of this.</p></div>

<p>Hearing nothing accurately of the India fleet after
its departure from Mount&rsquo;s Bay, Lydia Grenfell thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
betrayed to herself and laid before God her loving
anxiety:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1805, September 24.</i>&mdash;Have I not reason ever, and in
all things, to trust and bless God? O my soul, why dost
thou yield to despondency? why art thou disquieted? O
my soul, put thy trust in God, assured that thou shalt yet
praise Him, who is the help of thy countenance and thy
God in Christ Jesus. My mind is under considerable
anxiety, arising from the uncertainty of my dear friend&rsquo;s
situation, and an apprehension of his being ill. Oh, how
soon is my soul filled with confusion! yet I find repose for
it in the love of Jesus&mdash;oh, let me then raise my eyes to
Him, and may His love be shed abroad in my heart; make
me in all things resigned to Thy will, to trust and hope
and rejoice in Thee.</p>

<p><i>November 1.</i>&mdash;My dear absent friend has too much
occupied my thoughts and affections, and broken my peace&mdash;but
Jesus reigns in providence and grace, and He does
all things well. Yes, in my best moments I can rejoice in
believing this, but too often I yield to unbelieving fears and
discouragements. The thought that we shall meet no
more sinks at times my spirits, yet I would say and feel
submissive&mdash;Thy will be done. Choose for my motto, on
entering my thirty-first year, this Scripture: &lsquo;Our days on
the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>November 4.</i>&mdash;I think of my friend, but blessed be God
for not suffering my regard to lead me from Himself.</p>

<p><i>November 16.</i>&mdash;I have been employed to-day in a
painful manner, writing<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (perhaps for the last time) to too
dear a friend. I have to bless God for keeping me composed
whilst doing so, and for peace of mind since, arising
from a conviction that I have done right; and oh, that I
may now be enabled to turn my thought from all below to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that better world where my soul hopes eternally to dwell.
Blessed Lord Jesus, be my strength and shield. Oh, let
not the enemy harass me, nor draw my affections from
Thee.</p>

<p><i>November 17.</i>&mdash;Felt great depression of spirits to-day,
from the improbability of ever seeing H.M. return. I feel
it necessary to fly to God, praying for submission to His
will, and to rest assured of the wisdom and love of this
painful event. O my soul, rise from these cares, look
beyond the boundary of time. Oh, cheering prospect, in
that blest world where my Redeemer lives I shall regain
every friend I love&mdash;with Christian love again. Be
resigned then, my soul, Jesus is thine, and He does all
things well.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE NINE MONTHS&rsquo; VOYAGE&mdash;SOUTH AMERICA&mdash;SOUTH
AFRICA, 1805-1806</p>


<p>The East India fleet had been detained off Ireland &lsquo;for
fear of immediate invasion, in which case the ships might
be of use.&rsquo; The young chaplain was kept busy enough in
his own and the other vessels. In one of these, the Ann,
there was a mutiny. Another, the Pitt, was a Botany Bay
ship, carrying out 120 female convicts. Thanks to Charles
Simeon, he was able to supply all with Bibles and religious
books. But even on board his own transport, the Union,
the captain would allow only one service on the Sabbath,
and denied permission to preach to the convicts. The
chaplain&rsquo;s ministrations between decks were continued
daily, amid the indifference and even opposition of all
save a few.</p>

<p>At last, on August 31, 1805, the Indiamen of the season
and fifty transports sailed out of the Cove of Cork under
convoy of the Diadem, 64 guns, the Belliqueuse, 64 guns,
the Leda and Narcissus frigates, on a voyage which, after
two months since lifting the anchor at Portsmouth, lasted
eight and a half months to Calcutta. The Union had
H.M. 59th Regiment on board. Of its officers and men,
and of the East India Company&rsquo;s cadets and the officers
commanding them, he succeeded in inducing only five to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
join him in daily worship. His own presence and this
little gathering caused the vessel to be known in the fleet
as &lsquo;the praying ship.&rsquo; The captain died during the voyage
to the Cape. One of the ships was wrecked, the Union
narrowly escaping the same fate. Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i> reveals
an amount of hostility to himself and of open scoffing at
his message which would be impossible now. He fed his
spirit with the Word of God, which he loved to expound
to others. Leighton, especially the too little known <i>Rules
for Holy Living</i>, was ever in his hands. Augustine and
Ambrose delighted him, also Hooker, Baxter, Jonathan
Edwards, and Flavel, which he read to any who would
listen, while he spoke much to the Mohammedan Lascars.
He worked hard at Hindustani, Bengali, and Portuguese.
Not more faithfully reflected in his <i>Journal</i> than the tedium
of the voyage and the often blasphemous opposition of his
fellows are, all unconsciously, his own splendid courage,
his untiring faithfulness even when down with dysentery and
cough, his watchful prayerfulness, his longing for the spread
of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. As the solitary young saint paced
the deck his thoughts, too, were with the past&mdash;with Lydia,
in a way which, even he felt, did not leave him indisposed
for communion with God. From Funchal, Madeira, he
wrote to Lydia&rsquo;s sister: &lsquo;God knows how dearly I love you,
and Lydia and Sally (his younger sister), and all His saints
in England, yet I bid you all an everlasting farewell almost
without a sigh.&rsquo; His motto throughout the voyage was the
sentence in which Milner characterises the first Christians:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">To Believe, to Suffer, and to Love.</span>&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lydia Grenfell was thus committing to her
<i>Diary</i> these melancholy longings:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>November 22.</i>&mdash;Yesterday brought me most pleasing
intelligence from my dear friend, for which I have and do
thank Thee, O Lord my God. He assures us of his being
well, and exceedingly happy&mdash;oh, may he continue so. I
have discovered that insensibly I have indulged the hope
of his return, which this letter has seemed to lessen. I see
it is my duty to familiarise my mind to the idea of our
separation being for ever, with what feelings the thought is
admitted, the Lord&mdash;whose will I desire therein to be done&mdash;only
knows, and I find it a blessed relief to look to Him
for comfort. I can bear testimony to this, that the Lord
does afford me the needful support. I have been favoured
much within this day or two, and seem, if I may trust to
present feelings, to be inspired to ask the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign
will and pleasure concerning me and him. I look forward
to our meeting only in another state of existence, and oh,
how pure, how exalted will be our affection then! here it
is mixed with much evil, many pains, and great anxieties.
Hasten, O Lord, Thy coming, and fit me for it and for the
society of Thy saints in light. I desire more holiness,
more of Christ in my soul, more of His likeness. Oh, to be
filled with all Thy fulness, to be swallowed up in Thee!</p>

<p><i>November 23.</i>&mdash;Too much has my mind been occupied
to-day with a subject which must for ever interest me.
O Lord, have mercy on me! help can only come from
Thee. Let Thy blessed Word afford me relief; let the aids
of Thy Spirit be vouchsafed. Restore to me the joys of
Thy salvation.</p>

<p><i>November 24.</i>&mdash;Passed a night of little sleep, my mind
restless, confused, and unhappy. In vain did I endeavour
to fix my thoughts on spiritual things, and to drive away
those distressing fears of what may befall my dear friend.
Blessed for ever be the Lord that on approaching His
mercy-seat, through the blood of Jesus, I found peace, rest,
and an ability to rely on God for all things. I have through
the day enjoyed a sense of the Divine presence, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>blessed nearness to the Lord. To-night I am favoured
with a sweet calmness; I seem to have no desire to exert
myself. O Lord, animate, refresh my fainting soul. I see
how dangerous it is to admit any worldly object into the
heart, and how prone mine is to idolatry, for whatever has
the preference, that to God is an idol. Alas! my thoughts,
my first and last thoughts, are now such as prove that God
cannot be said to have the supreme place in my affections;
yet, blessed be His name, I can resign myself and all my
concerns to His disposal, and this is my heart&rsquo;s desire. Thy
will be done.</p>

<p><i>December 11.</i>&mdash;I seem reconciled to all before me, and
consider the Lord must have some great and wise purposes
to answer by suffering my affections to be engaged in the
degree they are. If it is only to exercise my submission
to His will, and to make me more acquainted with His
power to support and comfort me, it will be a great end
answered, and oh, may I welcome all He appoints for this
purpose. The mysteries of Providence are unfathomable.
The event must disclose them, and in this I desire to make
up my mind from henceforth no more to encourage the
least expectation of meeting my dear friend in this world.
O Lord, when the desire is so strong, how impossible is it
for me to do this; but Thou art able to strengthen me for
it. Oh, vouchsafe the needful help.</p>

<p><i>December 16.</i>&mdash;I have had many distressing feelings
to-day, and struggled with my heart, which is at times
rent, I may say, by the reflection that I have bidden adieu
for ever in this life to so dear a friend; but the blessed
employment the Lord has assisted me in, and the thought
that he is serving my blessed Lord Jesus, is most consolatory.
Oh, may I never more seek to draw him back from
the work. Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest
that I would not do this.</p>

<p><i>December 26.</i>&mdash;Went early to St. Hilary, where I had
an opportunity of reading the excellent prayers of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Church. I have been blest with sweet peace to-day&mdash;a
solemn expectation of entering eternity. I feel a sadness
of spirit at times (attended with a calm resignation of mind,
not unpleasing) at the remembrance of my friend, whom
I expect no more to see till we meet in heaven. Oh, blessed
hope that there we shall meet! Lord, keep us each in the
narrow way that leads to Thee.</p>

<p><i>December 31.</i>&mdash;The last in 1805&mdash;oh, may it prove the
most holy to my soul. I am shut out from the communion
of Thy saints in a measure; oh, let me enjoy more
communion with my God. Thou knowest my secret
sorrows, yea, Thou dost calm them by causing me to have
regard to a future life of bliss with Thee, when I shall see
and adore the wisdom of Thy dealings with me. Oh, my
idolatrous heart!</p></div>

<p>These passages occur in Henry Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>December 4.</i>&mdash;Dearest Lydia! never wilt thou cease to
be dear to me; still, the glory of God, and the salvation of
immortal souls, is an object for which I can part with thee.
Let us live then for God, separate from one another, since
such is His holy will. Hereafter we shall meet in a happier
region, and if we shall have lived and died, denying ourselves
for God, triumphant and glorious will our meeting be....</p>

<p><i>December 5.</i>&mdash;My mind has been running on Lydia,
and the happy scenes in England, very much; particularly
on that day when I walked with her on the sea-shore,
and with a wistful eye looked over the blue waves that
were to bear me from her. While walking the deck I
longed to be left alone, that my thoughts might run at
random. Tender feelings on distant scenes do not leave
me indisposed for communion with God; that which is
present to the outward senses is the greatest plague to me.
Went among the soldiers in the afternoon, distributing
oranges to those who are scorbutic. My heart was for some
hours expanding with joy and love; but I have reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
think that the state of the body has great influence on the
frames and feelings of the mind. Let the rock of my consolations
be not a variable feeling, but Jesus Christ and
His righteousness.</p></div>

<p>The fleet next touched at San Salvador, or Bahia, from
which Henry Martyn wrote to Mrs. Hitchins, his cousin,
asking her to send him by Corrie, who was coming out as
chaplain, &lsquo;your profile and Cousin Tom&rsquo;s and Lydia&rsquo;s. If
she should consent to it, I should much wish for her miniature.&rsquo;
The request, when it reached her, must have led to
such passages in her <i>Diary</i> as these:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, February 8.</i>&mdash;I have passed some days of pain
and weakness, but now am blessed again with health.
During the whole of this sickness I was afflicted with much
deadness of soul, and have had very few thoughts of God.
I felt, as strength returned, the necessity of more earnest
supplications for grace and spiritual life. I have ascertained
this sad truth, that my soul has declined in spiritual fervour
and liveliness since I have admitted an earthly object so
much into my heart. Ah! I know I have not power to
recall my affections, but God can, and I believe He will,
enable me to regulate them better. This thought has been
of great injury to me, as I felt no murmuring at the will of
God, nor disposed to act therein contrary to His will. I
thought I might indulge secretly my affection, but it has
been of vast disadvantage to me. I am now convinced,
and I do humbly (relying on strength from on high) resolve
no more to yield to it. Oh, may my conversation be in
heaven, and the glories of Immanuel be all my theme.</p>

<p><i>February 15.</i>&mdash;I have been much exercised yesterday
and to-day&mdash;walking in darkness, without light&mdash;and I
feel the truth of this Scripture: &lsquo;Your sins have separated
between you and your God.&rsquo; I have betrayed a most
unbecoming impatience and warmth of temper. My dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
absent friend, too, has been much in my mind. How many
times have I endured the pain of bidding him farewell!
I would not dare repine. I doubt not for a moment the
necessity of its being as it is, but the feelings of my mind
at particular seasons overwhelm me. My refuge is to
consider it is the will of God. Thy will, my God, be done.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn did not lose a day in discharging his
mission to the residents and slaves of that part of the coast
of Brazil, in the great commercial city and seat of the
metropolitan. His was the first voice to proclaim the pure
Gospel in South America since, three hundred years before,
Coligny&rsquo;s and Calvin&rsquo;s missionaries had been there silenced
by Villegagnon, and put to death. Martyn was frequently
ashore, almost fascinated by the tropical glories of the coast
and the interior, and keenly interested in the Portuguese
dons, the Franciscan friars, and the negro slaves. After his
first walk through the town to the suburbs, he was looking for
a wood in which he might rest, when he found himself at a
magnificent porch leading to a noble avenue and house.
There he was received with exuberant hospitality by the
Corrè family, especially by the young Señor Antonio, who
had received a University training in Portugal, and soon
learned to enjoy the society of the Cambridge clergyman.
In his visits of days to this family, his exploration of the
immediate interior and the plantations of tapioca and
pepper, introduced from Batavia, and his discussions with
its members and the priests on Roman Catholicism, all
conducted in French and Latin, a fortnight passed rapidly.
He was ever about his Master&rsquo;s business, able in speaking
His message to men and in prayer and meditation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> &lsquo;In a cool
and shady part of the garden, near some water, I sat and sang,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i14">O&rsquo;er the gloomy hills of darkness.
</span></div>

<p>I could read and pray aloud, as there was no fear of anyone
understanding me. Reading the eighty-fourth Psalm,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i13">O how amiable are Thy tabernacles,
</span></div>

<p>this morning in the shade, the day when I read it last under
the trees with Lydia was brought forcibly to my remembrance,
and produced some degree of melancholy.&rsquo; Refreshed
by the hospitality of San Salvador, he resumed the voyage
with new zeal for his Lord and for his study of such
authorities as Orme&rsquo;s <i>Indostan</i> and Scott&rsquo;s <i>Dekkan</i>, and
thus taking himself to task: &lsquo;I wish I had a deeper conviction
of the sinfulness of sloth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thus had he taken possession of Brazil, of South
America, for Christ. As he walked through the streets,
where for a long time he &lsquo;saw no one but negro slaves
male and female&rsquo;; as he passed churches in which &lsquo;they
were performing Mass,&rsquo; and priests of all colours innumerable,
and ascended the battery which commanded a view
of the whole bay of All Saints, he exclaimed, &lsquo;What happy
missionary shall be sent to bear the name of Christ to these
western regions? When shall this beautiful country be
delivered from idolatry and spurious Christianity? Crosses
there are in abundance, but when shall the doctrine of the
Cross be held up?&rsquo; In the nearly ninety years that have
gone since that time, Brazil has ceased to belong to the
house of Braganza, slavery has been abolished, the agents
of the Evangelical churches and societies of the United
States of America and the Bible societies have been sent
in answer to his prayer; while down in the far south Captain
Allen Gardiner, R.N., by his death for the savage people,
has brought about results that extorted the admiration of
Dr. Darwin. As Martyn went back to the ship for the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
time, after a final discussion on Mariolatry with the Franciscans,
rowed by Lascars who kept the feast of the
Hijra with hymns to Mohammed, and in converse with a
fellow-voyager who declared mankind needed to be
told nothing but to be sober and honest, he cried to God
with a deep sigh &lsquo;to interfere in behalf of His Gospel; for
in the course of one hour I had seen three shocking
examples of the reign and power of the devil in the form of
Popish and Mohammedan delusion and that of the natural
man. I felt, however, in no way discouraged, but only saw
the necessity of dependence on God.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Why did Henry Martyn&rsquo;s preaching and daily pastoral
influence excite so much opposition? Undoubtedly, as we
shall see, both in Calcutta and Dinapore, his Cornish-Celtic
temperament, possibly the irritability due to the disease
under which he was even then suffering, disabled him from
disarming opposition, as his friend Corrie, for instance, afterwards
always did. But we must remember to whom he
preached and what he preached, and the time at which he
preached, in the history not only of the Church of England,
but of Evangelical religion. He had himself been brought
out of spiritual darkness under the influence of Kempthorne
and Charles Simeon, by the teaching of Paul in his letters
to the Roman and the Galatian converts. To him sin was
exceeding sinful. The Pauline doctrine of sin and its one
remedy was the basis not only of his theology, but of his
personal experience and daily life. After a brief ministry
to the villagers of Lolworth and occasional sermons to his
fellow students in Cambridge, this Senior Wrangler and
Classic, yet young convert, was put in spiritual charge of a
British regiment and Indiaman&rsquo;s crew, and was the only
chaplain in a force of eight thousand soldiers, some with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
families, and many female convicts. At a time when the
dead churches were only beginning to wake up, after
the missions of the Wesleys and Whitfield, of William
Carey and Simeon, this youthful prophet was called to
reason of temperance, righteousness, and judgment to
come, with men who were practically as pagan or as
sceptical as Felix.</p>

<p>His second address at sea, on September 15, was from
Paul&rsquo;s sermon in the synagogue of Antioch in Pisidia
(Acts xiii. 38-39): <i>Through this man is preached unto you
the forgiveness of sins, &amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It was a full and free declaration
of God&rsquo;s love in Jesus Christ to sinful man, which he thus
describes in his <i>Journal</i>: &lsquo;In the latter part I was led
to speak without preparation on the all-sufficiency of
Christ to save sinners who came to Him with all their sins
without delay. I was carried away with a Divine aid to
speak with freedom and energy. My soul was refreshed,
and I retired seeing reason to be thankful!&rsquo; But the next
week&rsquo;s experience resulted in this: &lsquo;I was more tried by
the fear of man than I have ever been since God called me
to the ministry. The threats and opposition of those men
made me unwilling to set before them the truths which they
hated; yet I had no species of hesitation about doing it.
They had let me know that if I would preach a sermon
like one of Blair&rsquo;s they should be glad to hear it; but they
would not attend if so much of hell was preached.&rsquo;
Strengthened by our Lord&rsquo;s promise of the Comforter
(John xiv. 16), he next Sunday took for his text Psalm ix.
17: <i>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations
that forget God.</i> He thus concluded:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Pause awhile, and reflect! Some of you, perhaps, by
this time, instead of making a wise resolve, have begun to
wonder that so heavy a judgment should be denounced
merely against forgetfulness. But look at the affairs of
common life, and be taught by them. Do not neglect, and
want of attention, and not looking about us to see what we
have to do&mdash;do not any of these bring upon us consequences
as ruinous to our worldly business as any <span class="smcap">ACTIVE</span>
misbehaviour? It is an event of every day, that a man,
by mere laziness and inattention to his business, does as
certainly bring himself and family to poverty, and end his
days in a gaol, as if he were, in wanton mischief, to set fire
to his own house. So it is also with the affairs of the soul:
neglect of that&mdash;forgetfulness of God, who only can save
it&mdash;will work his ruin, as surely as a long and daring course
of profligate wickedness.</p>

<p>When any one has been recollecting the proper proofs
of a future state of rewards and punishments, nothing,
methinks, can give him so sensible an apprehension of
punishment or such a representation of it to the mind, as
observing that, after the many disregarded checks, admonitions,
and warnings which people meet with in the ways
of vice, folly, and extravagance warnings from their very
nature, from the examples of others, from the lesser inconveniences
which they bring upon themselves, from the
instructions of wise and good men&mdash;after these have been
long despised, scorned, ridiculed&mdash;after the chief bad consequences
(temporal consequences) of their follies have
been delayed for a great while, at length they break in
irresistibly like an armed force: repentance is too late to
relieve, and can serve only to aggravate their distress: the
case is become desperate; and poverty and sickness, remorse
and anguish, infamy and death, the effects of their
own doings, overwhelm them beyond possibility of remedy
or escape. This is an account of what is, in fact, the
general constitution of Nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But is the forgetfulness of God so light a matter?
Think what ingratitude, rebellion, and atheism there is at
the bottom of it! Sirs, you have &lsquo;a carnal mind, which is
enmity against God.&rsquo; (Rom. viii. 7.) Do not suppose
that you have but to make a slight effort, and you will
cease to forget Him: it is your nature to forget Him: it
is your nature to hate Him: so that nothing less than an
entire change of heart and nature will ever deliver you
from this state of enmity. Our nature &lsquo;is not subject to
the law of God, neither indeed can be. They that are in
the flesh cannot please God.&rsquo; (Rom. viii. 7, 8.) From this
state let the fearful menace in the text persuade you to
arise! Need we remind you again of the dreadfulness of
hell&mdash;of the certainty that it shall overtake the impenitent
sinner? Enough has been said; and can any of you be
still so hardened, and such enemies to your souls, as still
to cleave to sin? Will you still venture to continue any
more in the hazard of falling into the hands of God?
Alas! &lsquo;Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?&rsquo;
(Isa. xxxiii. 14.) &lsquo;Can thine heart endure, or can thine
hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee?
I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it!&rsquo; (Ezek. xxii.
14.) Observe, that men have dealt with sinners&mdash;ministers
have dealt with them&mdash;apostles, prophets, and angels have
dealt with them: at last, God will take them in hand, and
deal with them! Though not so daring as to defy God,
yet, brethren, in all probability you put on repentance.
Will you securely walk a little longer along the brink of
the burning furnace of the Almighty&rsquo;s fury? &lsquo;As the
Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
between thee and death!&rsquo; (1 Sam. xx. 3.) When you
lie down you know not but you may be in it before the
morning; and when you rise you know not but God may
say, &lsquo;Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of
thee!&rsquo; When once the word is given to cut you down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the business is over. You are cut off from your lying
refuges and beloved sins&mdash;from the world&mdash;from your
friends&mdash;from the light&mdash;from happiness&mdash;from hope, for
ever! Be wise, then, my friends, and reasonable: give
neither sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids, till
you have resolved, on your knees before God, to forget
Him no more. Go home and pray. Do not dare to fly,
as it were, in the face of your Maker, by seeking your
pleasure on His holy day; but if you are alarmed at this
subject, as well you may be, go and pray to God that you
may forget Him no more. It is high time to awake out of
sleep. It is high time to have done with hesitation: time
does not wait for you; nor will God wait till you are
pleased to turn. He hath bent His bow, and made it
ready: halt no more between two opinions: hasten&mdash;tarry
not in all the plain, but flee from the wrath to come. Pray
for grace, without which you can do nothing. Pray for
the knowledge of Christ, and of your own danger and
helplessness, without which you cannot know what it is to
find refuge in Him. It is not our design to terrify, without
pointing out the means of safety. Let us then observe,
that if it should have pleased God to awaken any of you
to a sense of your danger, you should beware of betaking
yourselves to a refuge of lies.</p>

<p>But, through the mercy of God, many among us have
found repentance unto life&mdash;have fled for refuge to the
hope set before them&mdash;have seen their danger, and fled to
Christ. Think with yourselves what it is now to have
escaped destruction; what it will be to hear at the last day
our acquittal, when it shall be said to others, &lsquo;Depart from
Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.&rsquo; Let the sense of the
mercy of God gild all the path of life. On the other hand,
since it is they who forget God that are to bear the weight
of His wrath, let us beware, brethren, how we forget Him,
through concern about this world, or through unbelief, or
through sloth. Let us be punctual in all our engagements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with Him. With earnest attention and holy awe ought we
to hear His voice, cherish the sense of His presence, and
perform the duties of His worship. No covenant relation
or Gospel grace can render Him less holy, less jealous, or
less majestic. &lsquo;Wherefore let us have grace, whereby we
may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear;
for our God is a consuming fire.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>The officers had seated themselves behind the preacher,
that they might retire in case of dislike, and one of them
employed himself in feeding the geese; so it had happened
in the case of the missionary Paul, and Martyn wrote: &lsquo;God,
I trust, blessed the sermon to the good of many. Some of
the cadets and soldiers were in tears.&rsquo; The complement<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
of this truth he soon after displayed to them in his sermon
on the message through Ezekiel xxxiii. 11. <i>As I live,
saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the
wicked.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Men have been found in all ages who have vented
their murmurs against God for the severity of His final
punishment, as well as for the painful continuance of His
judgments upon them in this life, saying, &lsquo;If our state be
so full of guilt and misery as is represented, and God is
determined to avenge Himself upon us, be it so; then
we must take the consequences.&rsquo; If God were to reply to
this impious complaint only by silence; if He were to
suffer the gloom of their hearts to thicken into tenfold
darkness, and give them up to their own malignity, till they
died victims to their own impiety and despair, the Lord
would still be righteous, they would then only eat of the
fruit of their doings. But, behold, the Lord gives a very
unexpected message, with which He bids us to follow men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to interrupt their sad soliloquies, to stop their murmurs.
&lsquo;Say unto them,&rsquo; saith He, &lsquo;As I live, saith the Lord God,
I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the
wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye, from
your evil ways; for why will ye die?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Behold the inseparable connexion&mdash;we must turn, or
die. Here there is a question put by God to sinners. Let
sinners then answer the question which God puts to them,&mdash;&lsquo;Why
will ye die?&rsquo; Is death a motive not strong
enough to induce you to forego a momentary pleasure?
Is it a light thing to fall into the hands of the living God?
Is a life of godliness so very intolerable as not to be repaid
by heavenly glory? Turn ye at His reproof&mdash;&lsquo;Why will
ye die?&rsquo; Is it because there is no hope? God has this
very hour testified with an oath that it is His desire to save
you. Yea, He at this moment expostulates with you and
beseeches you to seek Him. &lsquo;Why will ye die?&rsquo; You
know not why. If, then, you are constrained&mdash;now accustomed
as you are to self-vindication&mdash;to acknowledge your
unreasonableness, how much more will you be speechless
in the last day when madness will admit of no palliation,
and folly will appear without disguise!</p>

<p>Are any returned to God? Do any believe they are
really returned?&mdash;then here they have consolation. It is
a long time before we lose our slavish dread of God, for
our natural prejudices and mistakes become inveterate by
habit, and Satan opposes the removal of them. But come
now, and let us reason together. Will ye also dishonour
your God by accounting Him more willing to destroy than
to save you? <i>Will</i> ye think hardly of God? Oh, that I had
been able to describe as it deserves, His willingness to save!
Oh, that I could have borrowed the pen of a seraph, and
dipped it in a fount of light! Could plainer words be needed
to describe the wonders of His love? Hearken, my beloved
brethren! Hath He no pleasure in the death of the
wicked, and will He take pleasure in yours? Hath He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
promised His love, His tenderness to those who turn from
their wicked ways, and yet, when they are turned,
straightway forgot His promise? Harbour no more fearful,
unbelieving thoughts. But the reply is often that the fear
is not of God, but of myself, lest I have not turned away
from my evil ways. But this point may surely be ascertained,
brethren; and if it may, any further refinements
on this subject are derogatory to God&rsquo;s honour. Let these
words convince you that, if you are willing to be saved in
His way, He is willing to save you. It may be you will
still be kept in darkness, but darkness is not always the
frown of God; it is only Himself&mdash;thy shade on thy right
hand. Then tremble not at the hand that wipes away thy
tears; judge Him not by feeble sense, but follow Him,
though He lead thee by a way that thou knewest not.</p>

<p>There are some of you who have reason to hope that
you have turned from the error of your ways. Ye have
tasted that the Lord is gracious. It is but a taste, a foretaste,
an antepast of the feast of heaven. It was His
pleasure that you should turn from your ways; it is also
His good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Then what
shall we recommend to you, but gratitude, admiration, and
praise? &lsquo;Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God,
O Zion.&rsquo; Let each of us abundantly utter the memory of
His great goodness, and sing aloud of His righteousness.
Let each say, &lsquo;Awake, lute and harp; I myself will awake
right early.&rsquo; Let us join the chorus of angels, and all the
redeemed, in praising the riches of His love in His kindness
towards us through Christ Jesus.</p></div>

<p>As the fleet sailed from San Salvador, the captains were
summoned to the commodore, to learn that Cape Town
and the Dutch settlement formed the object of the expedition,
and that stout resistance was expected. This gave
new zeal to the chaplain, were that possible, in his dealings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
with the officers and men of his Majesty&rsquo;s 59th, and with
the cadets, to whom he taught mathematics in his unrewarded
friendliness. Many were down with dysentery,
then and long a peculiarly fatal disease till the use of
ipecacuanha. His constant service made him also for some
time a sufferer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1805, December 29.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;My beloved spake and
said unto me, Rise up, &amp;c. (Cant. ii. 10, 11). Ah! why cannot
I rise and go forth and meet my Lord? Every hindrance
is removed: the wrath of God, the guilt of sin, and
severity of affliction; there is nothing now in the world
that has any strong hold of my affections. Separated
from my friends and country for ever in this life, I have
nothing to distract me from hearing the voice of my
beloved, and coming away from this world and walking
with Him in love, amidst the flowers that perfume the
air of Paradise, and the harmony of the happy spirits
who are singing His praise. But alas! my heart is cold
and slothful. Preached on 2 Peter iii. 11, taking notice at
the end of these remarkable circumstances, that made the
text particularly applicable to us. It was the last Sabbath
of a year, which had been memorable to us from our
having left our country, and passed through many dangers.
Secondly, within a few days they were to meet an enemy
on the field of battle. Thirdly, the death of the captain.
I was enabled to be self-collected, and in some degree
tender. There was a great impression; many were in
tears. Visited and conversed with Mr. M. twice to-day,
and marked some passages for him to read. His heart
seems tender. There was a considerable number on
the orlop in the afternoon. Expounded Matt. xix. and
prayed. In the evening Major Davidson and M&rsquo;Kenzie
came to my cabin, and stayed nearly three hours. I read
Romans vi. and vii., and explained those difficult chapters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as well as I could, so that the Major, I hope, received a
greater insight into them; afterwards I prayed with them.
But my own soul after these ministrations seemed to have
received harm rather than good. It was an awful reflection
that Judas was a preacher, perhaps a successful one. Oh,
let my soul tremble, lest, after preaching to others, I myself
should be a castaway.</p>

<p><i>1806. January 4.</i>&mdash;Continued to approach the land;
about sunset the fleet came to an anchor between Robben
Island and the land on that side, farthest from Cape Town,
and a signal was immediately given for the 59th Regiment
to prepare to land. Our men were soon ready, and
received thirty-six rounds of ball cartridge; before the
three boats were lowered down and fitted, it was two in
the morning. I stayed up to see them off; it was a melancholy
scene; the privates were keeping up their spirits by
affecting to joke about the approach of danger, and the
ladies sitting in the cold night upon the grating of the
after-hatchway overwhelmed with grief; the cadets, with
M&rsquo;Kenzie, who is one of their officers, all went on board
the Duchess of Gordon, the general rendezvous of the
company&rsquo;s troops. I could get to speak to none of my
people, but Corporals B. and B. I said to Sergeant G.,
&lsquo;It is now high time to be decided in religion,&rsquo; he replied
with a sigh; to Captain S. and the cadets I endeavoured
to speak in a general way. I this day signed my name
as a witness to Captain O.&rsquo;s and Major Davidson&rsquo;s wills;
Captain O. left his with me; I passed my time at intervals
in writing for to-morrow. The interest I felt in the
outward scene distracted me very much from the things
which are not seen, and all I could do in prayer was
to strive against this spirit. But with what horror should
I reflect on the motions of sins within me, which tempted
me to wish for bloodshed, as something gratifying by
its sublimity. My spirit would be overwhelmed by such
a consciousness of depravity, but that I can pray still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
deliberately against sin; and often the Lord manifested His
power by making the same sinful soul to feel a longing
desire that the blessed gospel of peace might soothe
the spirits of men, and make them all live together in
harmony and love. Yet the principle within me may well
fill me with shame and sorrow.</p></div>

<p>Since, on April 9, 1652, Johan Anthonie van Riebeck
by proclamation took formal possession of the Cape for
the Netherlands East India Company, &lsquo;providing that the
natives should be kindly treated,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the Dutch had governed
South Africa for nearly a century and a half. The natives
had been outraged by the Boers, the Moravian missionaries
had departed, the colony had been starved, and yet denied
the rudiments of autonomy. The French Revolution
changed all that, and very much else. The Stadtholder of
the United Provinces having allied himself with Great
Britain, Dumouriez entered Holland, and Pichegru marched
the armies of France over its frozen waters in the terrible
winter of 1794-5. To protect the trade with India from
the French, Admiral Elphinstone thereupon took possession
of the Cape, which was administered successively by
General J.H. Craig, the Earl of Macartney, Sir George
Young, and Sir Francis Dundas, for seven prosperous
years, until the Treaty of Amiens restored it to the Batavian
Republic in February 1803. It was then a territory of
120,000 square miles, reaching from the Cape to a curved
line which extended from the mouth of the Buffalo River
in Little Namaqualand to the present village of Colesberg.
The Great Fish River was the eastern boundary. Now
the Christian colonies and settlements of South Africa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
enjoying British sovereignty and largely under self-governing
institutions, stretch north from the sea, and east and west
from ocean to ocean, to the great river Zambesi&mdash;the base
from which Christian civilisation, by missions and chartered
companies, is slowly penetrating the explored wilds of
Central Africa up the lake region to the Soudan and
Ethiopia.</p>

<p>This less than a century&rsquo;s progress has been made
possible by the expedition of 1806, in which Henry
Martyn, almost alone, represented Christianity. After the
three years&rsquo; respite given by the virtual armistice of Amiens,
Napoleon Bonaparte again plunged Europe and the world
into war. William Pitt&rsquo;s last government sent out this
naval armament under Sir Home Popham. The 5,000
troops were commanded by Sir David Baird, who had
fought and suffered in India when the senior of the future
Duke of Wellington. Henry Martyn has told us how the
squadron of the sixty-three sail had anchored between
Robben Island and the coast. The Dutch Governor,
General Jan Willen Janssens, was more worthy of his trust
than his predecessor ten years before. He had been compelled
to send on a large portion of his force for the defence
of Java, soon to fall to Lord Minto, the Governor-General,
and had only 2,000 troops left. He had received only a
fortnight&rsquo;s notice of the approach of the British fleet,
which was reported by an American vessel. He drilled
the colonists, he called French marines to his aid, he
organised Malay artillery, he embodied even Hottentot
sepoys, and made a reserve and refuge of Hottentot&rsquo;s
Holland, from which he hoped to starve Cape Town, should
Baird capture it. Both armies were equal in numbers at
least.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>All was in vain. On January 8 was fought the battle
of Blaauwberg (on the side of Table Bay opposite Cape
Town), from the plateau of which the Dutch, having stood
the musketry and field pieces, fled at the charge of the
bayonet with a loss of 700 men. The British, having
dropped 212, marched on Cape Town, halted at Papendorp,
and there, on January 10, 1806, were signed the articles of
capitulation which have ever since given the Roman-Dutch
law to the colony. Sir David Baird and Sir Home Popham
soon after received the surrender of Janssens, whose troops
were granted all the honours of war in consideration of
their gallant conduct. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815
Lord Castlereagh sacrificed Java to the Dutch, but kept
South Africa for Great Britain. The surrender of the
former, in the midst of the splendid successes of Sir
Stamford Raffles, is ascribed to that minister&rsquo;s ignorance of
geography. He knew equally little of the Cape, which he
kept, beyond its importance to India, but God has overruled
all that for the good of Equatorial, as well as South, Africa,
as, thanks to David Livingstone, vacillating statesmen have
begun to see.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i> thus describes the battle and
the battlefield.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, January.</i>&mdash;Ten o&rsquo;clock. When I got up, the
army had left the shore, except the Company&rsquo;s troops,
who remained to guard the landing-place; but soon after
seven a most tremendous fire of artillery began behind a
mountain abreast of the ship; it seemed as if the mountain
itself were torn by intestine convulsions. The smoke rose
from a lesser eminence on the right of the hill, and on the
top of it troops were seen rushing down the farther declivity;
then came such a long drawn fire of musketry, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
could not have conceived anything like it. We all shuddered
at considering what a multitude of souls must be
passing into eternity. The poor ladies were in a dreadful
condition, every peal seemed to go through their hearts; I
have just been endeavouring to do what I can to keep up
their spirits. The sound is now retiring, and the enemy
are seen retreating along the low ground on the right
towards the town. Soon after writing this I went ashore
and saw M&rsquo;K., &amp;c., and Cecil, with whom I had an agreeable
conversation on Divine things. The cadets of our ship
had erected a little shed made of bushes and straw, and
here, at their desire, I partook of their cheer. Three Highlanders
came to the lines just as I arrived, all wounded in
the hand. In consequence of their report of the number
of the wounded, a party of East India troops, with slings
and barrows, attended by a body of cadets with arms,
under Major Lumsden, were ordered to march to the field
of battle.</p>

<p>I attached myself to these, and marched six miles through
the soft burning sand with them. The first we came to was
a Highlander, who had been shot through the thigh, and
had walked some way from the field and lay spent under
some bushes. He was taken care of and we went on, and
passed the whole of the larger hill without seeing anything.
The ground then opened into a most extensive plain, which
extended from the sea to the blue mountains at a great
distance on the east. On the right was the little hill, to
which we were attracted by seeing some English soldiers;
we found that they were some wounded men of the 24th.
They had all been taken care of by the surgeons of the
Staff. Three were mortally wounded. One, who was
shot through the lungs, was spitting blood, and yet very
sensible. The surgeon desired me to spread a great-coat
over him as they left him; as I did this, I talked to him a
little of the blessed Gospel, and begged him to cry for
mercy through Jesus Christ. The poor man feebly turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
his head in some surprise, but took no further notice. I
was sorry to be obliged to leave him and go on after the
troops, from whom I was not allowed to be absent, out of
a regard to my safety. On the top of the little hill lay
Captain F., of the grenadiers of the same regiment, dead,
shot by a ball entering his neck and passing into his
head. I shuddered with horror at the sight; his face and
bosom were covered with thick blood, and his limbs rigid
and contracted as if he had died in great agony. Near
him were several others dead, picked off by the riflemen of
the enemy. We then descended into the plain where the
two armies had been drawn up.</p>

<p>A marine of the Belliqueuse gave me a full account of
the position of the armies and particulars of the battle. We
soon met with some of the 59th, one a corporal, who often
joins us in singing, and who gave the pleasing intelligence
that the regiment had escaped unhurt, except Captain
McPherson. In the rear of the enemy&rsquo;s army there were
some farm-houses, which we had converted into a receptacle
for the sick, and in which there were already two hundred,
chiefly English, with a few of the enemy. Here I entered,
and found that six officers were wounded; but as the
surgeon said they should not be disturbed, I did not go in,
especially as they were not dangerously wounded. In one
room I found a Dutch captain wounded, with whom I had
a good deal of conversation in French. After a few
questions about the army and the Cape, I could not help
inquiring about Dr. Vanderkemp; he said he had seen
him, but believed he was not at the Cape, nor knew how
I might hear of him. The spectacle at these houses was
horrid. The wounded soldiers lay ranged within and
without covered with blood and gore. While the India
troops remained here, I walked out into the field of battle
with the surgeon. On the right wing, where they had been
attacked by the Highland regiment, the dead and wounded
seemed to have been strewed in great numbers, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
knapsacks, &amp;c. Some of them were still remaining; with
a Frenchman whom I found amongst them I had some
conversation. All whom we approached cried out instantly
for water. One poor Hottentot I asked about Dr.
Vanderkemp, I saw by his manner that he knew him; he lay
with extraordinary patience under his wound on the burning
sand; I did what I could to make his position comfortable,
and laid near him some bread, which I found on the
ground. Another Hottentot lay struggling with his mouth
in the dust, and the blood flowing out of it, cursing the
Dutch in English, in the most horrid language; I told
him he should rather forgive them, and asked him about
God, and after telling him of the Gospel, begged he would
pray to Jesus Christ; but he did not attend. While the
surgeon went back to get his instrument in hopes of saving
the man&rsquo;s life, a Highland soldier came up, and asked me
in a rough tone, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; I told him, &lsquo;An Englishman;&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;No, no, you are French,&rsquo; and was going to
present his musket. As I saw he was rather intoxicated,
and might in mere wantonness fire, I went up to him and
told him that if he liked he might take me prisoner to the
English army, but that I was certainly an English clergyman.
The man was pacified at last. The surgeon on his
return found the thigh bone of the poor Hottentot broken,
and therefore left him to die. After this I found an
opportunity of retiring, and lay down among the bushes,
and lifted up my soul to God. I cast my eyes over the
plain which a few hours before had been the scene of
bloodshed and death, and mourned over the dreadful effects
of sin. How reviving to my thoughts were the blue
mountains on the east, where I conceived the missionaries
labouring to spread the Gospel of peace and love.</p></div>

<p>At sunrise on the 10th, a gun from the commodore&rsquo;s
ship was instantly answered by all the men-of-war, as the
British flag was seen flying on the Dutch fort. The future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
historian of the Christianisation of Africa will not fail to
put in the forefront, at the same time, the scene of Henry
Martyn, on his knees, taking possession of the land, and of
all lands, for Christ.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I could find it more agreeable to my own feelings to
go and weep with the relatives of the men whom the
English have killed, than to rejoice at the laurels they
have won. I had a happy season in prayer. No outward
scene seemed to have power to distract my thoughts. I
prayed that the capture of the Cape might be ordered to
the advancement of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom; and that England,
while she sent the thunder of her arms to the distant
regions of the globe, might not remain proud and ungodly
at home; but might show herself great indeed, by sending
forth the ministers of her Church to diffuse the gospel of
peace.</p></div>

<p>Thus on Africa, as on South America, North India,
Persia and Turkey, is written the name of Henry Martyn.</p>

<p>The previous government of the Cape by the British,
under Sir Francis Dundas, had been marked by the arrival,
in 1799, of the London Missionary Society&rsquo;s agents, Dr.
Vanderkemp and Kicherer. With the great chief Ngqika,
afterwards at Graaff Reinet and then near Algoa Bay, the
quondam Dutch officer, Edinburgh medical student, and
aged landed proprietor, giving his all to Christ, had
gathered in many converts. Martyn, who had learned
to admire Vanderkemp from his books, was even more
delighted with the venerable man. Driven by the Boers
into Cape Town, the old missionary, and Mr. Reid, his
colleague, were found in the midst of their daily services
with the Hottentots and Kafirs. In such society, worshipping
through the Dutch language, the India chaplain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
spent the greater part of the five weeks&rsquo; detention of the
Union. &lsquo;Dear Dr. Vanderkemp gave me a Syriac Testament
as a remembrance of him.&rsquo; When Martyn and Reid
parted, the latter for Algoa Bay, &lsquo;we spoke again of the
excellency of the missionary work. The last time I had
stood on the shore with a friend speaking on the same
subject, was with Lydia, at Marazion.&rsquo; In Isaiah, and
Leighton, especially his <i>Rules for a Holy Life</i>, the missionary
chaplain found comfort and stimulus.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>February 5, 1806.</i>&mdash;I am born for God only. Christ is
nearer to me than father, or mother, or sister,&mdash;a nearer
relation, a more affectionate friend; and I rejoice to follow
Him, and to love Him. Blessed Jesus! Thou art all I want&mdash;a
forerunner to me in all I ever shall go through, as a
Christian, a minister, or a missionary.</p>

<p><i>February 13.</i>&mdash;After breakfast had a solemn season in
prayer, with the same impressions as yesterday, from
Leighton, and tried to give up myself wholly to God, not
only to be resigned solely to His will, but to seek my only
pleasure from it, to depart altogether from the world, and
be exactly the same in happiness, whether painful or
pleasing dispensations were appointed me: I endeavoured
to realise again the truth, that suffering was my appointed
portion, and that it became me to expect it as my daily
lot. Yet after all, I was ready to cry out, what an unfortunate
creature I am, the child of sorrow and care; from
my infancy I have met with nothing but contradiction, but
I always solaced myself that one day it would be better,
and I should find myself comfortably settled in the enjoyment
of domestic pleasures, whereas, after all the wearying
labours of school and college, I am at last cut off from all
my friends, and comforts, and dearest hopes, without being
permitted even to hope for them any more. As I walked
the deck, I found that the conversation of others, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
own gloomy surmises of my future trials, affected me far
less with vexation, than they formerly did, merely from
this, that I took it as my portion from God, all whose
dispensations I am bound to consider and receive as the
fruits of infinite wisdom and love towards me. I felt,
therefore, very quiet, and was manifestly strengthened from
above with might in my inner man; therefore, without any
joy, without any pleasant considerations to balance my
present sickness and gloom, I was contented from the
reflection, that it was God who did it. I pray that this
may be my state&mdash;neither to be anxious to escape from
this stormy sea that was round the Cape, nor to change
the tedious scene of the ship for Madras, nor to leave this
world merely to get rid of the troubles of it, but to glorify
God where I am, and where He puts me, and to take each
day as an important trust for Him, in which I have much
to do both in suffering and acting. Employed in collecting
from the New Testament all the passages that refer to our
walking in Christ.</p>

<p><i>February 18.</i>&mdash;Completed my twenty-fifth year. Let
me recollect it to my own shame, and be warned by it, to
spend my future years to a better purpose; unless this be
the case, it is of very little consequence to notice when
such a person came into the world. Passed much of the
morning in prayer, but could not succeed at all in getting
an humble and contrite spirit; my pride and self-esteem
seemed unconquerable. Wrote sermon with my mind
impressed with the necessity of diligence: had the usual
service, and talked much to a sick man. Read Hindustani.</p>

<p><i>February 27.</i>&mdash;Rose once more after a sleepless night,
and had in consequence a peevish temper to contend with.
Had a comfortable and fervent season of prayer, in the
morning, while interceding for the heathen from some of
the chapters in Isaiah. How striking did those words
Isaiah xlii. 8 appear to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> &lsquo;I am the Lord, that is My
name; and My glory will I not give to another, neither My
praise to graven images.&rsquo; Lord, is not Thy praise given to
graven images in India? Here, then, is Thine own express
word that it shall not continue to be so. And how easy is
it for the mighty God that created the heavens and stretched
them out, that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh
out of it; that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and
spirit to them that walk therein; to effect His purposes in
a moment. What is caste? What are inveterate prejudices,
and civil power, and priestly bigotry, when once the
Lord shall set to His hand? Who knows whether even the
present generation may not see Satan&rsquo;s throne shaken to
its base in India? Learning Hindustani words in the
morning; in the afternoon below, and much hurt at the
cold reception the men gave me.</p>

<p><i>March 7.</i>&mdash;Endeavoured this morning to consider Christ
as the High Priest of my profession. Never do I set
myself to understand the nature of my walk in Christ
without getting good to my soul. Employed as usual
through the day. Heard from M&rsquo;Kenzie that they are not
yet tired with inveighing against my doctrines. They took
occasion also to say, from my salary, that &lsquo;Martyn, as well
as the rest, can share the plunder of the natives in India;
whether it is just or not he does not care.&rsquo; This brought
back the doubts I formerly had about the lawfulness of
receiving anything from the Company. My mind is not
yet comfortable about it. I see it, however, my duty to
wait in faith and patience, till the Lord shall satisfy my
doubts one way or other. I would wish for no species of
connection with the East India Company, and notwithstanding
the large sums I have borrowed on the credit of
my salary, which I shall never be able to repay from any
other means, I would wish to become a missionary,
dependent on a society; but I know not how to decide.
The Lord in mercy keep my soul in peace. Other thoughts
have occurred to me since. A man who has unjustly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
got possession of an estate hires me as a minister to
preach to his servants, and pays me a salary: the money
wherewith he pays me comes unjustly to him, but justly to
me. The Company are the acknowledged proprietors of
the country, the ruling power. If I were to refuse to go
there, I might, on the same account, refuse to go to France,
and preach to the French people or bodyguard of the
emperor, because the present monarch who pays me is
not the lawful one. If there were a company of
Mohammedan merchants or Mohammedan princes in
possession of the country, should I hesitate to accept an
offer of officiating as chaplain among them, and receiving a
salary?</p>

<p><i>March 14.</i>&mdash;<i>Suavissima vita est indies sentire se fieri
meliorem.</i> So I can say from former experience more
than from present. But oh, it is the ardent desire of my
soul to regard all earthly things with indifference, as one
who dwells above with God. May I grow in grace; may
the grace of God, which bringeth salvation, teach me to
become daily more spiritual, more humble, more steadfast
in Christ, more meek, more wise, and in all things to live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. How
shall I attain to greater heavenly-mindedness? Rose
refreshed after a good night&rsquo;s sleep, and wrote on a subject;
had much conversation with Mr. B. upon deck; he seemed
much surprised when I corrected his notions on religion,
but received what I said with great candour. He said
there was a minister at Madras, a Dane, with whom Sir D.
Baird was well acquainted, who used to speak in the same
manner of religion, whose name was Schwartz. My
attention was instantly roused at the venerable name, and
I eagerly inquired of him all the particulars with which he
was acquainted. He had often heard him preach, and Mr.
Jænicke had often breakfasted with him; Schwartz, he
said, had a very commanding manner, and used to preach
extempore in English at Madras; he died very poor. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the afternoon had a service below; much of the evening
M&rsquo;Kenzie passed with me, and prayed.</p>

<p><i>March 26.</i>&mdash;Passed much time before breakfast in
sitting on the poop, through utter disinclination to all
exertion. Such is the enervating effect of the climate;
but after staying some hours learning Hindustani words,
2 Timothy ii. roused me to a bodily exertion. I felt
strong in spirit, resolving, if I died under it, to make the
body submit to robust exercise; so I walked the deck
with great rapidity for an hour and a half. My animal
spirits were altered instantly; I felt a happy and joyful
desire to brave the enervating effects of India in the
service of the blessed Lord Jesus. B. still delirious and
dying fast: the first thing he said to me when I visited
him this afternoon, was, &lsquo;Mr. Martyn, what will you choose
for a kingdom?&rsquo; I made no answer to this, but thought
of it a good deal afterwards. What would I choose?
Why, I do not know that anything would be a heaven to
me, but the service of Christ, and the enjoyment of His
presence.</p></div>

<p>In this spirit, coasting Ceylon, and getting his first
sight of India at the Danish mission station of Tranquebar,
on April 22, 1806, Henry Martyn landed at Madras. To
Mr. Hitchins he afterwards wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There was nothing remarkable in this first part of
India which I visited; it was by no means so romantic as
America. Vast numbers of black people were walking
about with no dress but a little about their middle, but no
European was to be seen except here and there one in a
palanquin. Once I preached at Fort St. George, though
the chaplains hardly knew what to make of such sort of
preaching; they were, however, not offended. Finding that
the people would bear to be addressed plainly, and not
really think the worse of a minister for dealing closely with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
their consciences, they determined, they said, to preach the
Gospel as I did; but I fear that one, if not both, has yet to
learn what the Gospel is. I breakfasted one day with Sir
E. Pellew, the Port Admiral at Madras, and met S. Cole,
his captain. I was perfectly delighted to find one with
whom I could speak about St. Hilary and Marazion; we
spoke of every person, place, and thing we could think of
in your neighbourhood.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="subheading">INDIA AND THE EAST IN THE YEAR 1806</p>


<p>Henry Martyn reached India, and entered on his official
duties as chaplain and the work of his heart as missionary
to North India, at a time when the Anglo-Indian community
had begun to follow society in England, in a
reformation of life and manners, and in a corresponding
desire to do good to the natives. The evangelical reaction
set in motion by the Pietists, Moravians, and Marrow-men,
John Wesley and Whitfield, Andrew Fuller and Simeon,
John Erskine and the Haldanes, had first affected South
India and Madras, where Protestant Christian Missions
were just a century old. The Danish-Halle men, led by
Ziegenbalg and Schwartz, had found support in the Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge from the year 1709.
So early as 1716 an East India Company&rsquo;s chaplain, the
Rev. William Stevenson, wrote a remarkable letter to that
society,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> &lsquo;concerning the most effectual way of propagating
the Gospel in this (South India) part of the world.&rsquo; He
urged a union of the several agencies in England, Denmark,
and Germany into one common Society for Promoting the
Protestant Missions, the formation of colleges in Europe
to train missionaries, the raising of an annual income of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
3,000<i>l.</i>, and the maintenance therewith of a staff of at
least eight well-qualified missionaries. By a century and
a half he anticipated the proposal of that union which
gives strength and charity; the erection of colleges, at
Tranquebar and Madras, to train native ministers, catechists,
and schoolmasters, and the opening of free schools
in every considerable place superintended by the European
missionaries on the circle system. Another Madras
chaplain, the Rev. George Lewis, was no less friendly
and helpful to Ziegenbalg; he was Mr. Stevenson&rsquo;s predecessor,
and wrote in 1712.</p>

<p>In North India&mdash;where the casteless races of the hills,
corresponding to the Shanars around Cape Comorin, were
not discovered till far on in the present century&mdash;almost
everything was different. By the time that the Evangelical
Church directed its attention to Calcutta, the East India
Company had become a political, and consequently an
intolerant, power. It feared Christian proselytism, and it
encouraged Hindu and Mohammedan beliefs and institutions.
Whereas, in Madras, it gladly used Schwartz,
subsidised the mission with 500 pagodas or 225<i>l.</i> a year,
and had always conveyed the missionaries&rsquo; freight in its
ships free of charge, in Bengal it kept out missionaries, or
so treated them with all the rigour of the law against
&lsquo;interlopers,&rsquo; that William Carey had to begin his career
as an indigo planter, and seek protection in Danish
Serampore, where he became openly and only a preacher
and teacher of Christ. North India, too, with Calcutta
and Benares as its two Hindu centres, and Lucknow and
Delhi as its two Mohammedan centres, Shiah and Soonni,
was, and is, the very citadel of all the non-Christian world.
The same Gospel which had proved the power of God to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the simple demonolators of the Dravidian south, must be
shown to be the wisdom of God to the Koolin of Bengal,
the Brahman of Kasi, the fanatical Muslim from Dacca, and
ultimately to Peshawur and Cabul, Persia and Arabia. The
Himalayan and Gangetic land&mdash;from which Buddhism
overran Eastern and Southern Asia&mdash;must again send
forth a missionary message to call Cathay to Christ.</p>

<p>The Christianising of North India began in 1758, the
year after the battle of Plassey, when, as Governor, the
conqueror, Clive, welcomed his old acquaintance, of the
Cuddalore Mission, the Swede Kiernander, to Calcutta, and
gave him a rent-free house for eight years. Even Burke
was friendly with Clive, writing of him: &lsquo;Lord Clive once
thought himself obliged to me for having done what I
thought an act of justice towards him;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and it is pleasant
thus to be able in any way to link that name with the
purely spiritual force which used the Plassey and the
Mutiny wars, as it will direct all events, for making
India Christ&rsquo;s. The first church, built in 1715 by the
merchants and captains, had been destroyed by a hurricane;
the second had been demolished by Suraj-ood-Dowlah,
in the siege of Calcutta, two years before, and
one of the two chaplains had perished in the Black Hole,
while the other was driven away. For the next thirty
years the few who went to the chaplains&rsquo; church worshipped
in a small bungalow in the old fort, where Kiernander
opened his first school. By 1771-4 he had formed such
a congregation of poor Christians&mdash;Portuguese, Roman
Catholics, and Bengali converts&mdash;that he built and extended
the famous Mission Church and School-house, at a cost of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
12,000<i>l.</i>, received from both his marriages. When, by
becoming surety for another, the old man lost his all, and
blindness added to his sorrows, he left an English congregation
of 147 members, and a Native congregation of 119,
half Portuguese or Eurasians, and half Bengali.</p>

<p>Kiernander&rsquo;s Mission Church was the centre of the
religious life of Calcutta and Bengal. Six years after its
foundation there came to Calcutta, from Madras, Mr.
William Chambers&mdash;who had been converted by Schwartz&mdash;and
John Christian Obeck, who had been one of the
catechists of the Apostle of South India. Chambers had
not been a year in the capital when he found out Charles
Grant, at that time overwhelmed by a domestic sorrow,
and brought him to Christ. Grant soon after went to
Maldah as Commercial Resident, where he had as his
subordinates, George Udny, Ellerton, W. Brown, W. Grant,
J. Henry, and Creighton. These men, with their families,
Sir Robert Chambers, of the Supreme Court, Mrs. Anne
Chambers who was with her sons, Mrs. Chapman, and
others less known, formed the nucleus of a Christian
community which first supported Thomas as a medical
missionary, then welcomed Carey, and, with the assistance
of two Governor-Generals, Sir John Shore and Lord
Wellesley, changed the tone of Anglo-Indian society.
Sir William Jones, too, in his brief career of six years, set
an example of all the virtues. Henry Martyn had two
predecessors as Evangelical chaplains and missionary
philanthropists, the Yorkshire David Brown, and the
Scottish Claudius Buchanan.</p>

<p>David Brown, an early friend of Simeon and Fellow of
Magdalen College, was recovering from a long illness in
1785, when a letter reached him from London, proposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that he should seek ordination, and in ten days he accompanied
Captain Kirkpatrick to Calcutta to superintend the
Military Orphan School. The officers of the Bengal Army
had unanimously resolved to tax themselves for the removal
and prevention of the scandal caused by the number of
boys and girls left destitute&mdash;no fewer than 500 at that
time. This noble school, the blessings of which were soon
extended to the white and coloured offspring of non-commissioned
officers and soldiers also, was organised at
Howrah by Brown, who then was made chaplain to a
brigade, and afterwards one of the Fort William or
Presidency chaplains. He found the Mission practically
non-existent, owing to Kiernander&rsquo;s losses and old age. To
save the buildings from sale by the sheriff, Charles Grant
bought them for 10,000 rupees and vested them in himself,
Mr. A. Chambers, and Mr. Brown, by a deed providing that
they remain appropriated to the sole purposes of religion.
Until the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge
could send out a minister, David Brown greatly extended
the work of Kiernander. At one time it was likely that
Henry Martyn would be sent out by Mr. Grant. Under the
Church Missionary Society the Mission Church of Calcutta
has ever since been identified with all that is best in pure
religion and missionary enterprise in the city of Calcutta.</p>

<p>When sending out the Rev. A.T. Clarke, B.A. of Trinity
College, Cambridge, who soon after became a chaplain, the
Christian Knowledge Society, referring to Schwartz and
Germany, fertile in missionaries, declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> &lsquo;It has been the
surprise of many, and the lamentation of more, that fortitude
thus exemplified should not have inspired some of our own
clergy with an emulation to follow and to imitate these
champions of the Cross, thus seeking and thus contending
to save them who are lost.&rsquo; That was in 1789, when the
Society and Dr. Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, along with
Simeon, Wilberforce, and the other Clapham men, had
before it, officially, the request of Charles Grant, Chambers
and Brown to send out eight English missionaries on 350<i>l.</i>
a year each, to study at Benares and attack Hinduism
in its very centre. Not till 1817 was the first Church of
England missionary, as such, the Rev. William Greenwood,
to settle in Ceylon and then in Bengal. Even he became
rather an additional chaplain to the invalid soldiers at
Chunar.</p>

<p>After a career not unlike that of John Newton, who
first directed his attention to India, Claudius Buchanan,
whom his father had intended to educate for the ministry
of the Church of Scotland, wandered to London, was sent to
Queen&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, by Mr. Thornton of Clapham;
there came under Simeon&rsquo;s influence, and was appointed to
Bengal as a chaplain by Mr. Grant. That was in 1796.
For the next ten years in Barrackpore and Calcutta as
the trusted chaplain of Lord Wellesley, by his researches
in South India, by his promotion of Bible translation, and
by the interest in the Christianising of India which his
generous prizes excited in the Universities and Churches of
England and Scotland, Dr. Claudius Buchanan was the
foremost ecclesiastic in the East. He at once gave an
impulse to the silent revolution which David Brown began
and the Serampore missionaries carried on. His Christian
statesmanship commended him to all the authorities, and
soon the new Cathedral of St. John, which Warren
Hastings had erected to supersede the old Bungalow
Church, became filled with an attentive and devout congregation,
as well as the mission church. These two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and William Carey formed the pillars of the College of Fort
William, by which Lord Wellesley not only educated the
young civilians and military officers in the Oriental
languages, and in their duties to the natives, but developed
a high ideal of public life and personal morality. Such
was the growth of Christian feeling alike in the army and
the civil service, and such the sense of duty to the rapidly increasing
Eurasian community, as well as to the natives,
that by 1803 Claudius Buchanan submitted to the Governor-General,
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishop
Porteus, his <i>Thoughts on the Expediency of an Ecclesiastical
Establishment for British India</i>. It took ten years, covering
the whole period of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s activities and life, from
this time for the proposal to be legislatively carried out in
the East India Company&rsquo;s Charter of 1813.</p>

<p>Practically&mdash;except in Maldah residency during the
influence of Grant, Udny, and Carey at the end of last
century&mdash;the reformation was confined to Calcutta, as we
shall see. It was a young lieutenant of the Company&rsquo;s
army who was the first to draw the attention of the
Governor-General, Sir John Shore, in 1794, to the total
neglect of religion in Bengal. Lieutenant White wrote
that he had been eleven years in the country without
having had it in his power to hear the public prayers of
the Church above five times. He urged the regular
worship of God, the public performance of Divine service,
and preaching at all the stations. He proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> &lsquo;additional
chaplains to the Company&rsquo;s complement for considerable
places which now have none to officiate. Unless places
were erected at the different stations for assembling to
Divine service, it must be impossible for chaplains even to
be able to do their duty, and to assemble the people together.&rsquo;
The letter delighted the Governor-General, who said of it
to David Brown, &lsquo;I shall certainly recommend places to
be made at the stations, and shall desire the General who
is going up the country to take this matter in charge, and
to fix on spots where chapels shall be erected.&rsquo; Nothing
was done in consequence of this, however. It was left to
Martyn, and the other chaplains who were in earnest, to
find or create covered places for worship at the great military
stations. Claudius Buchanan himself could not hold
regular services at Barrackpore, close to Calcutta, for want
of a church, and that was supplied long after by adapting
and consecrating the station theatre!</p>

<p>The figures in Buchanan&rsquo;s published Memoir on the
Expediency of an Ecclesiastical Establishment, enable us
to estimate exactly the spiritual destitution of the Protestant
subjects of the British Government in Asia. Twelve
years after Lieutenant White, Sir John Shore, David
Brown, and Claudius Buchanan first raised the question,
and when Henry Martyn began his ministrations to all
classes, there were 676,557 Protestant subjects in India,
Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, and Canton, Roman Catholics and
Syrian Christians not included. In the three Presidencies
of India alone there were 156,057, of whom 7,257 were
civil and military officers and inhabitants, 6,000 were the
Company&rsquo;s European troops, 19,800 were the King&rsquo;s troops,
110,000 were Eurasians, and 13,000 were &lsquo;native Protestant
Christians at Tanjore.&rsquo; In Bengal alone&mdash;that is,
North India&mdash;there were fifty stations, thirty-one civil and
nineteen military, many of which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> &lsquo;without the
offices of religion for twenty years past, though at each
there reside generally a judge, a collector, a commercial
resident, with families, together with their assistants and
families, and a surgeon;&rsquo; also indigo planters, tradesmen,
and other European inhabitants and the alarmingly large
number of Eurasians. In Bengal alone there were 13,299
European Protestants, of whom 2,467 were civil servants
and military officers; of the whole 13,299, &lsquo;a tenth part do
not return to England,&rsquo; and desire Christian education and
confirmation for their children. Yet &lsquo;at present there are
but three churches in India, the chief of which was aided in
construction by Hindu contribution.&rsquo; The India <i>Journals
and Letters</i> of Martyn must be read in the light of all
this.</p>

<p>It was thus that the successive generations of soldiers
and civilians who won for Christian England its Indian
Empire in the century from Clive to Wellesley, Hastings,
and Dalhousie, were de-Christianised. Not till the
close of the Mutiny war in 1858 did John Lawrence,
first as Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab and then as
Viceroy, and Sir Robert Montgomery as Lieutenant-Governor,
lead the Queen&rsquo;s Government to do its duty, by
erecting, or helping Christians to erect, a chapel in every
station up to Peshawur and Burma&mdash;that, to use Buchanan&rsquo;s
language in 1806, &lsquo;the English soldiers and our countrymen
of all descriptions, after long absence from a Christian
country, may recognise a church.&rsquo; Including Ceylon,
Buchanan&rsquo;s scheme proposed an annual expenditure of
144,000<i>l.</i> for four dioceses, with 50 English chaplains and
100 native curates, 200 schoolmasters and 4 colleges to
train both Europeans and natives for the ministry; of
this, Parliament to give 100,000<i>l.</i> The ecclesiastical
establishment of India&mdash;without Ceylon, but including
Church of Scotland chaplains, and grants to Wesleyans
and Roman Catholics&mdash;now costs India itself 160,000<i>l.</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
year, while the annual value of the lands devoted to the non-Christian
cults is many millions sterling. With all this,
and the aid of the Additional Clergy and Anglo-Indian
Evangelisation Societies, and of the missionaries to the
natives, Great Britain does not meet the spiritual wants of
the now enormous number and scattered communities of
Christian soldiers and residents in its Indian Empire.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn went out to India at a time when the
government of India had been temporarily entrusted to
one of the only three or four incompetent and unworthy
men who have held the high office of Governor-General.
Sir George Barlow was a Bengal civilian of the old type,
whom Lord Wellesley had found so zealous and useful
in matters of routine that he had recommended him
as provisional Governor-General. But the moment that
that proconsul had seated the East India Company on the
throne of the Great Mogul, as has been said, and Lord
Cornwallis, who had been hurried out a second time to
undo his magnificent and just policy, had died at Ghazipore,
Sir George Barlow showed the most disastrous zeal in
opposition to all his former convictions. By withholding
from Sindia the lamentable despatch of September 19, 1805,
which Lord Cornwallis had signed when the unconsciousness
of death had already weakened his efficiency, Lord Lake
gave the civil authorities a final opportunity to consider
their ways. But Barlow&rsquo;s stupidity&mdash;now clothed with the
almost dictator&rsquo;s power of the highest office under the
British Crown, as it was in those days&mdash;deliberately declared
it to be his desire, not only to fix the limit of our
empire at the Jumna, a river fordable by an enemy at all
times, but to promote general anarchy beyond that frontier
as the best security for British peace within it. The peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of Southern Asia and the good of its peoples were postponed
for years, till, with difficulty, the Marquis of Hastings
restored the empire to the position in which Lord Wellesley
had left it. Sir George Barlow is responsible for the twelve
years&rsquo; anarchy of British India, from 1805 to 1817. His
administration, which became such a failure that he was removed
to Madras, and was from even that province recalled,
must rank as a blot on the otherwise unbroken splendour
and benevolence to the subject races of the government of
South Asia in the century and a half from Clive to Lord
Lansdowne.</p>

<p>The man who, from dull stolidity more than from
Macchiavellian craft, thus again plunged half India into
a series of wars by chief upon chief and creed upon creed,
was no less guilty of intolerance to Christianity within the
Company&rsquo;s territories. On the one hand, in opposition
to the views of Lord Wellesley, and even of the Court of
Directors led by Charles Grant, he made the Company&rsquo;s
government the direct manager of the Poori temple of
Jaganath and its dancing girls; on the other, he would have
banished the Serampore and all Christian missionaries
from the country, but for the courageous opposition of
the little Governor of that Danish settlement. All too late
he was relieved by Lord Minto, whom the Brahmanised
officials of 1807 to 1810 used for a final and futile effort
to crush Christianity out of India, to the indignation
of Henry Martyn, whose language in his <i>Journal</i> is not
more unmeasured than the intolerance deserves. But
in his purely foreign policy Lord Minto proved that
he had not held the office of President of the Board
of Control in vain. He once more asserted the only
reason for the existence of a foreign power in India,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> &lsquo;the
suppression of intestine disorder,&rsquo; clearing Bundelkhund
of robber chiefs and military strongholds. Surrounded and
assisted by the brilliant civilians and military officers whom
Wellesley and Carey had trained&mdash;men like Mountstuart
Elphinstone, Metcalfe and Malcolm&mdash;Lord Minto proved
equal to the strain which the designs of Napoleon Bonaparte
in the Treaty of Tilsit put upon our infant empire in the
East. He sent Metcalfe to Lahore, and confined the dangerous
power of Ranjeet Singh to the north of the Sutlej.
He despatched Elphinstone to Cabul, introducing the wise
policy which has converted Afghanistan into a friendly
subsidised State; and through Malcolm he opened Persia
to English influence, paving the way for the embassy of
Wellesley&rsquo;s friend, Sir Gore Ouseley, and&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;for
the kindly reception of Henry Martyn.</p>

<p>It was on April 22, 1806, at sunrise, that the young
chaplain landed from the surf-boat on the sands of Madras.
His experience at San Salvador had prepared him for
the scene, and even for the crowds of dark natives, though
not for &lsquo;the elegance of their manners.&rsquo; &lsquo;I felt a solemn
sort of melancholy at the sight of such multitudes of
idolators. While the turbaned Asiatics waited upon us at
dinner, about a dozen of them, I could not help feeling
as if we had got into their places.&rsquo; He visited the native
suburb in which his Hindustani-speaking servants dwelt,
and was depressed by its &lsquo;appearance of wretchedness.&rsquo;
His soul was filled with the zeal of the Old Testament
prophets against idolatry, the first sight of which&mdash;of men,
women, and children, mad upon their idols&mdash;produces an
impression which he does not exaggerate: &lsquo;I fancy the
frown of God to be visible.&rsquo; He lost not a day in
commending his Master to the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> &lsquo;Had a good deal of
conversation with a Rajpoot about religion, and told him
of the Gospel.&rsquo; The young natives pressed upon the
new-comer as usual. &lsquo;Rose early, but could not enjoy
morning meditations in my walk, as the young men would
attach themselves to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was much in the society of the Rev. Dr. Kerr<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
the other Madras chaplains; one of these was about to
proceed to Seringapatam, where Martyn urged him to
&lsquo;devote himself to the work of preaching to the natives.&rsquo;
This was ever foremost in his thoughts. He spent days in
obtaining from Dr. Kerr &lsquo;a vast deal of information about
all the chaplains and missionaries in the country, which he
promised to put in writing for me.&rsquo; Schwartz was not then
dead ten years, and Dr. Kerr, who had known him and
Guericke well, gave his eager listener many details of the
great missionary.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Felt excessively delighted with accounts of a very
late date from Bengal, describing the labours of the missionaries,
and was rather agitated at the confusion of
interesting thoughts that crowded upon me; but I reasoned,
Why thus? God may never honour you with a missionary
commission; you must expect to leave the field, and bid
adieu to the world and all its concerns.</p></div>

<p>On his first Sunday in India, April 27, 1806, Henry
Martyn assisted in the service in the church at Fort St.
George, and preached from Luke x. 41, 42,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> &lsquo;One thing is
needful.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There was much attention, and Lord William sent
to Dr. Kerr afterwards to request a copy of the sermon;
but I believe it was generally thought too severe. After
dinner, went to Black Town to Mr. Loveless&rsquo;s chapel. I
sat in the air at the door enjoying the blessed sound of
the Gospel on an Indian shore, and joining with much
comfort in the song of divine praise. With young
Torriano I had some conversation respecting his entering
the ministry, as he spoke the Malabar tongue fluently.
Walked home at night enjoying the presence of God.</p>

<p><i>April 28.</i>&mdash;This morning, at breakfast, Sir E. Pellew came
in and said: &lsquo;Upon my word, Mr. Martyn, you gave us a
good trimming yesterday.&rsquo; As this was before a large
company, and I was taken by surprise, I knew not what to
say. Passed most of the day in transcribing the sermon.
There was nothing very awakening in it. About five in
the evening I walked to Dr. Kerr&rsquo;s, and found my way
across the fields, which much resembled those near
Cambridge; I stopped some time to take a view of the
men drawing &lsquo;toddy&rsquo; from the tree, and their manner of
ploughing.</p>

<p><i>April 30.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted at Sir E. Pellew&rsquo;s with Captain
S. Cole of the Culloden. I had a good deal of conversation
about our friends at St. Hilary and Marazion.
Continued at home the rest of the day transcribing sermon,
and reading Zechariah. In the evening drove with Dr.
Kerr to Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s, the Persian translator, five or six
miles in the country. We had some useful conversation
about the languages. On my return walked by moonlight
in the grounds reflecting on the mission. My soul was at
first sore tried by desponding thoughts: but God wonderfully
assisted me to trust Him for the wisdom of His dispensations.
Truly, therefore, will I say again, &lsquo;Who art thou,
O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a
plain.&rsquo; How easy for God to do it! and it shall be done
in good time: and even if I never should see a native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
converted, God may design by my patience and continuance
in the work to encourage future missionaries.
But what surprises me is the change of views I have here
from what I had in England.&mdash;There, my heart expanded
with hope and joy at the prospect of the speedy conversion
of the heathen! but here, the sight of the apparent impossibility
requires a strong faith to support the spirits.</p></div>

<p>The &lsquo;Lord William&rsquo; of the <i>Journal</i> is the Governor of
Madras, Lord William Bentinck, whom, at the beginning
of his Indian career, it is interesting to find thus pleasantly
brought into contact with Henry Martyn&mdash;just as he
became the fast friend of Alexander Duff, at the close of
his long and beneficent services to his country and to
humanity. In two months thereafter the Vellore Mutiny
was to break out, through no fault of his, and he was to be
recalled by an act of injustice for which George Canning
and the Court of Directors atoned twenty years after by
appointing him Governor-General.</p>

<p>After a fortnight off Madras, the Union once more
set sail under the convoy of the Victor sloop-of-war.
Every moment the young scholar had sought to add to
his knowledge of Hindustani and Persian. He changed
his first native servant for one who could speak Hindustani.
He drove with Dr. Kerr to Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s, the Persian
translator to Government. &lsquo;We had some useful conversation
about the languages.&rsquo; On the voyage to Calcutta,
he was &lsquo;employed in learning Bengali. Passed the afternoon
on the poop reading Sale&rsquo;s <i>Al Coran</i>.&rsquo; Only
missionary thoughts and aspirations ruled his mind, now
despairing of his own fitness; now refreshed as he turned
from the Church Missionary Society&rsquo;s reports to the
evangelical prophecies of Malachi; again praying for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
young missionaries of the London Society as he passed
Vizagapatam, and for &lsquo;poor India&rsquo; as he came in sight of
the Jaganath pagoda, &lsquo;much resembling in appearance
Roche Rock in Cornwall ... the scene presented another
specimen of that tremendous gloom with which the devil
has overspread the land.&rsquo; After taking a pilot on board
in Balasore Roads, where Carey had first landed, the ship
was driven out to sea by a north-wester, and Henry
Martyn suffered from his first sunstroke. In three days
she anchored in the Hoogli, above Culpee, and on May 13
bumped on that dreaded shoal, the James and Mary.
&lsquo;The captain considered the vessel as lost. Retired as
soon as possible for prayer, and found my soul in peace at
the prospect of death.&rsquo; She floated off, exchanging most
of the treasure into a tender which lay becalmed off
the Garden Reach suburb, then &lsquo;very beautiful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Henry Martyn landed at Calcutta in the height of
the hot season, on May 16, 1806. Claudius Buchanan
had passed him at the mouth of the Hoogli, setting out
on the tour of the coasts of India, which resulted in the
<i>Christian Researches</i>. David Brown was in his country
retreat at Aldeen, near Serampore.</p>

<p>The man whom, next to his own colleagues, he first
sought out was the quondam shoemaker of Hackleton, and
poor Baptist preacher of Moulton, the Bengali missionary to
whose success Charles Simeon had pointed him when fresh
from the triumph of Senior Wrangler; the apostle then forty-five
years of age, who was busy with the duties of Professor
of Sanskrit, Bengali, and Marathi, in the College of Fort
William, that he might have the Bible translated into all
the languages of Asia, and preached in all the villages of
North India.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, May 16.</i>&mdash;Went ashore at daylight this morning,
and with some difficulty found Carey: Messrs. Brown and
Buchanan being both absent from Calcutta. With him I
breakfasted, joined with him in worship, which was in
Bengali for the advantage of a few servants, who sat,
however, perfectly unmoved. I could not help contrasting
them with the slaves and Hottentots at Cape Town, whose
hearts seemed to burn within them. After breakfast Carey
began to translate, with a Pandit, from a Sanskrit manuscript.
Presently after, Dr. Taylor came in. I had engaged a boat
to go to Serampore, when a letter from Mr. Brown found
me out, and directed me to his house in the town, where
I spent the rest of the day in solitude, and more comfortably
and profitably than any time past. I enjoyed
several solemn seasons in prayer, and more lively impressions
from God&rsquo;s Word. I felt elevated above those distressing
fears and distractions which pride and worldliness
engender in the mind. Employed at times in writing to
Mr. Simeon, Mr. Brown&rsquo;s moonshi; a Brahmin of the name
of B. Roy came in and disputed with me two hours about
the Gospel. I was really surprised at him; he spoke English
very well and possessed more acuteness, good sense,
moderation, and acquaintance with the Scriptures than I
could conceive to be found in an Indian. He spoke with
uncommon energy and eloquence, intending to show that
Christianity and Hinduism did not materially differ. He
asked me to explain my system, and adduce the proofs of
it from the Bible, which he said he believed was the Word
of God. When I asked him about his idolatry, he asked
in turn what I had to say to our worshipping Christ. This
led to inquiries about the Trinity, which, after hearing what
I had to say, he observed was actually the Hindu notion.
I explained several things about the Jews and the Old
Testament, about which he wanted information, with all
which he was amazingly pleased. I feel much encouraged
by this to go to instruct them. I see that they are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
religious people, as St. Paul called the Athenians, and my
heart almost springs at the thought that the time is
ripening for the fulness of the Gentiles to come in.</p>

<p><i>May 17.</i>&mdash;A day more unprofitable than the foregoing;
the depravity of my heart, as it is in its natural frame,
appeared to me to-day almost unconquerable. I could not,
however long in prayer, keep the presence of God, or the
power of the world to come, in my mind at all. It sunk
down to its most lukewarm state, and continued in general
so, in spite of my endeavours. Oh, how I need a deep
heartrending work of the Spirit upon myself, before I shall
save myself, or them that hear me! What I hear about my
future destination has proved a trial to me to-day. My
dear brethren, Brown and Buchanan, wish to keep me here,
as I expected, and the Governor accedes to their wishes.
I have a great many reasons for not liking this; I almost
think that to be prevented going among the heathen as a
missionary would break my heart. Whether it be self-will
or aught else, I cannot yet rightly ascertain. At all events
I must learn submission to everything. In the multitude
of my thoughts Thy comforts delight my soul. I have been
running the hurried round of thought without God. I have
forgotten that He ordereth everything. I have been bearing
the burden of my cares myself, instead of casting them all
upon Him. Mr. Brown came in to-day from Serampore,
and gave me directions how to proceed; continued at home
writing to E. In the afternoon went on board, but without
being able to get my things away. Much of the rest of
the day passed in conversation with Mr. Brown. I feel
pressed in spirit to do something for God. Everybody is
diligent, but I am idle; all employed in their proper work,
but I tossed in uncertainty; I want nothing but grace; I
want to be perfectly holy, and to save myself and those that
hear me. I have hitherto lived to little purpose, more like
a clod than a servant of God; now let me burn out for
God.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="subheading">CALCUTTA AND SERAMPORE, 1806</p>


<p>&lsquo;Now let me burn out for God!&rsquo; Such were the words with
which Henry Martyn began his ministry to natives and
Europeans in North India, as in the secrecy of prayer he
reviewed his first two days in Calcutta. Chaplain though
he was, officially, at the most intolerant time of the East
India Company&rsquo;s administration, he was above all things a
missionary. Charles Simeon had chosen him, and Charles
Grant had sent him out, for this as well as his purely
professional duty, and it never occurred to him that he could
be anything else. He burned to bring all men to the same
peace with God and service to Him which he himself
had for seven years enjoyed. We find him recording his
great delight, now at an extract sent to him from the East
India Company&rsquo;s Charter, doubtless the old one from
William III., &lsquo;authorising and even requiring me to teach
the natives,&rsquo; and again on receiving a letter from Corrie,
&lsquo;exulting with thankfulness and joy that Dr. Kerr was
preaching the Gospel. Eight such chaplains in India! this
is precious news indeed.&rsquo; Even up to the present time no
Christian in India has ever recognised so fully, or carried
out in a brief time so unrestingly, his duty to natives and
Europeans alike as sinners to be saved by Jesus Christ alone.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s first Sunday in Calcutta was spent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
worship in St. Johns, the &lsquo;new church,&rsquo; when Mr. Jefferies
read one part and Mr. Limerick another of the service, and
Mr. Brown preached. Midday was spent with &lsquo;a pious
family where we had some agreeable and religious conversation,
but their wish to keep me from the work of the
mission and retain me at Calcutta was carried farther than
mere civility, and showed an extraordinary unconcern for
the souls of the poor heathens.&rsquo; In the evening, though
unwell with a cold and sore throat, he ventured to read the
service in the mission or old church of Kiernander. He
was there &lsquo;agreeably surprised at the number, attention,
and apparent liveliness of the audience. Most of the
young ministers that I know would rejoice to come from
England if they knew how attractive every circumstance is
respecting the church.&rsquo; Next day he was presented at the
levée of Sir George Barlow, acting Governor-General, &lsquo;who,
after one or two trifling questions, passed on.&rsquo; He then spent
some time in the College of Fort William, where he was
shown Tipoo&rsquo;s library, and one of the Mohammedan
professors&mdash;a colleague of Carey&mdash;chanted the Koran.
Thence he was rowed with the tide, in an hour and a half,
sixteen miles up the Hoogli to Aldeen, the house of
Rev. David Brown in the suburb of Serampore, which became
his home in Lower Bengal. On the next two Sundays
he preached in the old church of Calcutta, and in the new
church &lsquo;officiated at the Sacrament with Mr. Limerick.&rsquo;
It was on June 8 that he preached in the new church, for
the first time, his famous sermon from 1 Cor. i. 23, 24,
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> &lsquo;<i>Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and
unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are
called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and
the wisdom of God</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This is his own account of the immediate result:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, June 8.</i>&mdash;The sermon excited no small ferment;
however, after some looks of surprise and whispering, the
congregation became attentive and serious. I knew what I
was to be on my guard against, and therefore, that I might
not have my mind full of idle thoughts about the opinions of
men, I prayed both before and after, that the Word might be
for the conversion of souls, and that I might feel indifferent,
except on this score.</p></div>

<p>We cannot describe the sermon, as it was published
after his death, and again in 1862, more correctly than by
comparing it to one of Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s, save that, in style,
it is a little more academic and a little less Saxon or
homely. But never before had the high officials and
prosperous residents of Calcutta, who attended the church
which had become &lsquo;fashionable&rsquo; since the Marquess
Wellesley set the example of regular attendance, heard
the evangel preached. The chaplains had been and were
of the Arian and Pelagian type common in the Church
till a later period. They at once commenced an assault
on their young colleague and on the doctrines by
which Luther and Calvin had reformed the Churches of
Christendom. This was the conclusion of the hated
sermon:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is, in every congregation, a large proportion of
Jews and Greeks. There are persons who resemble the
Jews in self-righteousness; who, after hearing the doctrines
of grace insisted on for years, yet see no occasion at all for
changing the ground of their hopes. They seek righteousness
&lsquo;not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law:
for they stumble at that stumbling-stone&rsquo; (Rom. ix. 32);
or, perhaps, after going a little way in the profession of the
Gospel, they take offence at the rigour of the practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
which we require, as if the Gospel did not enjoin it. &lsquo;This
is a hard saying,&rsquo; they complain; &lsquo;who can hear it?&rsquo; (John
vi. 60), and thus resemble those who first made the
complaint, who &lsquo;went back and walked no more with Him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Others come to carp and to criticise. While heretics
who deny the Lord that bought them, open infidels,
professed atheists, grossly wicked men, are considered as
entitled to candour, liberality, and respect, they are pleased
to make serious professors of the Gospel exclusively
objects of contempt, and set down their discourses on the
mysteries of faith as idle and senseless jargon. Alas!
how miserably dark and perverse must they be who think
thus of that Gospel which unites all the power and wisdom
of God in it. After God has arranged all the parts of His
plan, so as to make it the best which in His wisdom could
be devised for the restoration of man, how pitiable their
stupidity and ignorance to whom it is foolishness! And,
let us add, how miserable will be their end! because they
not only are condemned already, and the wrath of God
abideth on them, but they incur tenfold danger: they not
only remain without a remedy to their maladies, but have
the guilt of rejecting it when offered to them. This is
their danger, that there is always a stumbling-block in the
way: the further they go, the nearer are they to their fall.
They are always exposed to sudden, unexpected destruction.
They cannot foresee one moment whether
they shall stand or fall the next; and when they do fall
they fall at once without warning. Their feet shall slide
in due time. Just shame is it to the sons of men, that He
whose delight it was to do them good, and who so loved
them as to shed His blood for them, should have so many
in the world to despise and reject His offers; but thus is
the ancient Scripture fulfilled&mdash;&lsquo;The natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God&rsquo; (1 Cor. ii. 14).</p>

<p>Tremble at your state, all ye that from self-righteousness,
or pride, or unwillingness to follow Him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
regeneration, disregard Christ! Nothing keeps you one
moment from perdition but the mere sovereign pleasure
of God. Yet suppose not that we take pleasure in contradicting
your natural sentiments on religion, or in giving
pain by forcing offensive truths upon your attention&mdash;no! as
the ministers of joy and peace we rise up at the command
of God, to preach Christ crucified to you all. He died for
His bitterest enemies: therefore, though ye have been
Jews or Greeks, self-righteous, ignorant, or profane&mdash;though
ye have presumed to call His truths in question, treated
the Bible with contempt, or even chosen to prefer an idol
to the Saviour&mdash;yet return, at length, before you die, and
God is willing to forgive you.</p>

<p>How happy is the condition of those who obey the
call of the Gospel. Their hope being placed on that way
of salvation which is the <i>power</i> and <i>wisdom</i> of God, on
what a broad, firm basis doth it rest! Heaven and earth
may pass away, though much of the power and wisdom
of God was employed in erecting that fabric; but the
power and wisdom themselves of God must be cut off
from His immutable essence, and pass away, before one
tittle of your hope can fail. Then rejoice, ye children of
Wisdom, by whom she is justified. Happy are your eyes,
for they see; and your ears, for they hear; and the things
which God hath hidden from the wise and prudent, He
hath revealed unto you. Ye were righteous in your own
esteem; but ye &lsquo;count all things but loss for the excellency
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.&rsquo; Then be not
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, &lsquo;which is the power of
God unto salvation unto every one that believeth&rsquo;; but
continue to display its efficacy by the holiness of your
lives, and live rejoicing in hope of the glory of God.</p></div>

<p>The opposition of the officers and many of the troops
on board the transport had made the preacher familiar with
attack and misrepresentation, but not less faithful in ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>pounding
the Gospel of the grace of God as he himself had
received it to his joy, and for his service to the death. But
the ministrations of David Brown for some years might
have been expected to have made the civilians and merchants
of Calcutta more tolerant, if not more intelligent.
They were, however, incited or led by the two other chaplains
thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, June 16.</i>&mdash;Heard that Dr. Ward had made an
intemperate attack upon me yesterday at the new church,
and upon all the doctrines of the Gospel. I felt like the
rest, disposed to be entertained at it; but I knew it to be
wrong, and therefore found it far sweeter to retire and pray,
with my mind fixed upon the more awful things of another
world.</p>

<p><i>June 22.</i>&mdash;Attended at the new church, and heard Mr.
Jefferies on the evidences of Christianity. I had laboured
much in prayer in the morning that God would be pleased
to keep my heart during the service from thinking about
men, and I could say as I was going, &lsquo;I will go up to Thy
house in the multitude of Thy mercies, and in Thy fear will
I worship toward Thy holy temple.&rsquo; In public worship
I was rather more heavenly-minded than on former
occasions, yet still vain and wandering. At night preached
on John x. 11: &lsquo;I am the good shepherd;&rsquo; there was great
attention. Yet felt a little dejected afterwards, as if I
always preached without doing good.</p>

<p><i>July 6.</i>&mdash;Laboured to have my mind impressed with
holy things, particularly because I expected to have a personal
attack from the pulpit. Mr. Limerick preached from
2 Pet. i. 13, and spoke with sufficient plainness against me
and my doctrines. Called them inconsistent, extravagant,
and absurd. He drew a vast variety of false inferences
from the doctrines, and thence argued against the doctrines
themselves. To say that repentance is the gift of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
was to induce men to sit still and wait for God. To teach
that Nature was wholly corrupt was to lead men to despair;
that men thinking the righteousness of Christ sufficient to
justify, will account it unnecessary to have any of their
own: this last assertion moved me considerably, and I
started at hearing such downright heresy. He spoke of
me as one of those who understand neither what they say
nor whereof they affirm, and as speaking only to gratify
self-sufficiency, pride, and uncharitableness. I rejoiced at
having the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper afterwards, as
the solemnities of that blessed ordinance sweetly tended to
soothe the asperities and dissipate the contempt which was
rising; and I think I administered the cup to <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> and
<span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> with sincere good-will. At night I preached on John
iv. 10, at the mission church, and, blessed be God! with an
enlarged heart. I saw <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> in tears, and that encouraged
me to hope that perhaps some were savingly affected, but
I feel no desire except that my God should be glorified.
If any are awakened at hearing me, let me not hear of it
if I should glory.</p>

<p><i>August 24.</i>&mdash;At the new church, Mr. Jefferies preached.
I preached in the evening on Matt. xi. 28, without much
heart, yet the people as attentive as possible.</p>

<p><i>August 25.</i>&mdash;Called on Mr. Limerick and Mr. Birch;
with the latter I had a good deal of conversation on the
practicability of establishing schools, and uniting in a
society. An officer who was there took upon him to call
in question the lawfulness of interfering with the religion
of the natives, and said that at Delhi the Christians were
some of the worst people there. I was glad at the prospect
of meeting with these Christians. The Lord enabled me
to speak boldly to the man, and to silence him. From
thence I went to the Governor-General&rsquo;s levée, and received
great attention from him, as, indeed, from most
others here. Perhaps it is a snare of Satan to stop my
mouth, and make me unwilling to preach faithfully to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
them. The Lord have mercy, and quicken me to diligence.</p>

<p><i>August 26.</i>&mdash;At night Marshman came, and our conversation
was very refreshing and profitable. Truly the
love of God is the happiness of the soul! My soul felt
much sweetness at this thought, and breathed after God.
At midnight Marshman came to the pagoda, and awakened
me with the information that Sir G. Barlow had sent word
to Carey not to disperse any more tracts nor send out
more native brethren, or in any way interfere with the
prejudices of the natives. We did not know what to make
of this; the subject so excited me that I was again deprived
of necessary sleep.</p>

<p><i>August 28.</i>&mdash;Enjoyed much comfort in my soul this
morning, and ardour for my work, but afterwards consciousness
of indolence and unprofitableness made me uneasy.
In the evening Mr. Marshman, Ward, Moore, and Rowe
came up and talked with us on the Governor&rsquo;s prohibition
of preaching the Gospel, &amp;c. Mr. Brown&rsquo;s advice was full
of wisdom, and weighed with them all. I was exceedingly
excited, and spoke with vehemence against the measures
of government, which afterwards filled me justly with
shame.</p></div>

<p>The earnestness of the young chaplain was such that
&lsquo;the people of Calcutta,&rsquo; or all the Evangelicals, joined
even by the Baptist missionaries at Serampore, gave him
no rest that he might consent to become minister of the
mission or old church, with a chaplain&rsquo;s salary and house.
Dr. Marshman urged that thus he might create a missionary
spirit and organise missionary undertakings of more value
to the natives than the preaching of any one man. But
he remained deaf to the temptation, while he passed on the
call to Cousin T. Hitchins and Emma, at Plymouth. His
call was not to preach even in the metropolis of British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
India, the centre of Southern Asia; but, through their own
languages, to set in motion a force which must win North
India, Arabia, and Persia to Christ, while by his death he
should stir up the great Church of England to do its duty.</p>

</div>

<p>Serampore was the scene of his praying, his communing,
and his studying, while every Sunday was given
to his duties in Calcutta, as he waited five months for his
first appointment to a military station. David Brown had
not long before acquired Aldeen House, with its tropical
garden and English-like lawn sloping down to the river,
nearly opposite the Governor-General&rsquo;s summer-house and
park of Barrackpore. Connected with the garden was the
old and architecturally picturesque temple of the idol
Radha-bullub, which had been removed farther inland
because the safety of the shrine was imperilled by the river.
But the temple still stands, in spite of the rapid Hoogli
at its base, and the more destructive peepul tree which has
spread over its massive dome. In 1854, when the present
writer first visited the now historic spot, even the platform
above the river was secure, but that has since disappeared,
with much of the fine brick moulding and tracery work.
Here was the young saint&rsquo;s home; ever since it has been
known as Henry Martyn&rsquo;s Pagoda, and has been an object
of interest to hundreds of visitors from Europe and America.</p>

<span class="caption">A BRICK FROM HENRY MARTYN&rsquo;S PAGODA</span>
</div>

<p>Henry Martyn became one of David Brown&rsquo;s family,
with whom he kept up the most loving correspondence
almost to his death. But he spent even more time with
the already experienced missionaries who formed the
famous brotherhood a little farther up the right bank of
the Hoogli. Carey thus wrote of him, knowing nothing
of the fact that it was his own earlier reports which,
in Simeon&rsquo;s hands, had first led Martyn to desire the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>missionary career: &lsquo;A young clergyman, Mr. Martyn, is
lately arrived, who is possessed of a truly missionary spirit.
He lives at present with Mr. Brown, and as the image or
shadow of bigotry is not known among us here, we take
sweet counsel together and go to the house of God as
friends.&rsquo; Later on, the founder of the Modern Missionary
enterprise, who desired to send a missionary to every great
centre in North India, declared of the Anglican chaplain
that, wherever he went no other missionary would be
needed. The late Mr. John Clark Marshman, C.S.I., who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as a lad saw them daily, wrote: &lsquo;A strong feeling of
sympathy drew him into a close intimacy with Dr. Marshman,
and they might be often seen walking arm in arm, for
hours together, on the banks of the river between Aldeen
House and the Mission House.&rsquo; To the last he addressed
Dr. Marshman, in frequent letters, as his &lsquo;dear brother,&rsquo;
anticipating the catholic tenderness of Bishop Heber.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Martyn attended those family lectures of Ward on the
Hindus which resulted in his great book on the subject.
In the Pagoda, &lsquo;Carey, Marshman, and Ward joined in the
same chorus of praise with Brown, Martyn, and Corrie.&rsquo;
Martyn himself gives us these exquisite unconscious
pictures of Christian life in Serampore, in which all true
missionaries face to face with the common enemy have
followed the giants of those days.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, May 19.</i>&mdash;In the cool of the evening we walked
to the mission-house, a few hundred yards off, and I at last
saw the place about which I have so long read with pleasure.
I was introduced to all the missionaries. We sat down
about one hundred and fifty to tea, at several long tables
in an immense room. After this there was evening service
in another room adjoining, by Mr. Ward. Mr. Marshman
then delivered his lecture on grammar. As his observations
were chiefly confined to the Greek, and seemed intended
for the young missionaries, I was rather disappointed,
having expected to hear something about the Oriental
languages. With Mr. M. alone I had much conversation,
and received the first encouragement to be a missionary
that I have met with since I came to this country. I
blessed God in my heart for this seasonable supply of
refreshment. Finding my sore throat and cough much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
increased, I thought there might be some danger, and felt
rather low at the prospect of death. I could scarcely tell
why. The constant uneasiness I am in from the bites of
the mosquitoes made me rather fretful also. My habitation
assigned me by Mr. Brown is a pagoda in his grounds, on
the edge of the river. Thither I retired at night, and really
felt something like superstitious dread at being in a place
once inhabited, as it were, by devils, but yet felt disposed
to be triumphantly joyful that the temple where they were
worshipped was become Christ&rsquo;s oratory. I prayed out
aloud to my God, and the echoes returned from the vaulted
roof. Oh, may I so pray that the dome of heaven may
resound! I like my dwelling much, it is so retired and
free from noise; it has so many recesses and cells that I
can hardly find my way in and out.</p>

<p><i>May 20.</i>&mdash;Employed in preparing a sermon for to-morrow,
and while walking about for this purpose, my
body and mind active, my melancholy was a little relieved
by the hope that I should not be entirely useless as a
missionary. In the evening I walked with Mr. Brown, to see
the evening worship at a pagoda whither they say the god
who inhabited my pagoda retired some years ago. As we
walked through the dark wood which everywhere covers
the country, the cymbals and drums struck up, and never
did sounds go through my heart with such horror in my
life. The pagoda was in a court, surrounded by a wall,
and the way up to it was by a flight of steps on each side.
The people to the number of about fifty were standing on
the outside, and playing the instruments. In the centre of
the building was the idol, a little ugly black image, about
two feet high, with a few lights burning round him. At
intervals they prostrated themselves with their foreheads to
the earth. I shivered at being in the neighbourhood of
hell; my heart was ready to burst at the dreadful state to
which the Devil had brought my poor fellow-creatures. I
would have given the world to have known the language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to have preached to them. At this moment Mr. Marshman
arrived, and my soul exulted that the truth would now be
made known. He addressed the Brahmins with a few
questions about the god; they seemed to be all agreed
with Mr. Marshman, and quite ashamed at being interrogated,
when they knew they could give no answer. They
were at least mute, and would not reply; and when he
continued speaking they struck up again with their detestable
music, and so silenced him. We walked away in
sorrow, but the scene we had witnessed gave rise to a very
profitable conversation, which lasted some hours. Marshman
in conversation with me alone sketched out what he
thought would be the most useful plan for me to pursue in
India; which would be to stay in Calcutta a year to learn
the language, and when I went up the country to take one
or two native brethren with me, to send them forth, and
preach occasionally only to confirm their word, to establish
schools, and visit them. He said I should do far more
good in the way of influence than merely by actual
preaching. After all, whatever God may appoint, prayer
is the great thing. Oh, that I may be a man of prayer;
my spirit still struggles for deliverance from all my
corruptions.</p>

<p><i>May 22.</i>&mdash;In our walk at sunset, met Mr. Marshman,
with whom I continued talking about the languages.
Telling Mr. Brown about my Cambridge honours, I found
my pride stirred, and bitterly repented having said anything
about it. Surely the increase of humility need not
be neglected when silence may do it.</p>

<p><i>May 23.</i>&mdash;Was in general in a spiritual, happy frame
the whole day, which I cannot but ascribe to my being
more diligent and frequent in prayer over the Scriptures,
so that it is the neglect of this duty that keeps my soul so
low. Began the Bengali grammar, and got on considerably.
Continued my letters to Mr. Simeon and Emma.
At night we attended a conference of the missionaries on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
this subject: &lsquo;Whether God could save sinners without
the death of Christ.&rsquo; Messrs. Carey, Marshman, and Ward
spoke, Mr. Brown and myself. I offered what might be
said on the opposite side of the question to that which the
rest took, to show that He might have saved them without
Christ. About fourteen of the Bengali brethren were
present and spoke on the subject. Ram Roteen prayed.</p>

<p><i>Monday, May 26.</i>&mdash;Went up to Serampore with Mr.
Brown, with whom I had much enlivening conversation.
Why cannot I be like Fletcher and Brainerd, and those
men of modern times? Is anything too hard for the
Lord? Cannot my stupid stony heart be made to flame
with love and zeal? What is it that bewitches me, that I
live such a dying life? My soul groans under its bondage.
In the evening Marshman called; I walked back with him,
and was not a little offended at his speaking against the
use of a liturgy. I returned full of grief at the offences
which arise amongst men, and determined to be more alone
with the blessed God.</p>

<p><i>May 29.</i>&mdash;Had some conversation with Marshman
alone on the prospects of the Gospel in this country, and
the state of religion in our hearts, for which I felt more
anxious. Notwithstanding, I endeavoured to guard against
prating only to display my experience; I found myself
somewhat ruffled by the conversation, and derived no
benefit from it, but felt desirous only to get away from the
world, and to cease from men; my pride was a little hurt
by Marshman&rsquo;s questioning me as the merest novice. He
probably sees farther into me than I see into myself.</p>

<p><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;Still exceedingly feeble; endeavoured to
think on a subject, and was much irritated at being unable
to write a word. Mrs. Brown, and afterwards Mr. Brown,
paid me a visit. I came into the house to dinner, but while
there I felt as if fainting or dying, and indeed really thought
I was departing this life. I was brought back again to the
pagoda, and then on my bed I began to pray as on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
verge of eternity. The Lord was pleased to break my
hard heart, and deliver me from that satanic spirit of light
and arrogant unconcern about which I groaned out my
complaint to God. From this time I lay in tears, interceding
for the unfortunate natives of this country; thinking
with myself, that the most despised Soodra of India was
of as much value, in the sight of God, as the King of Great
Britain: through the rest of the day my soul remained in
a spirit of contrition.</p>

<p><i>June 14.</i>&mdash;A pundit came to me this morning, but after
having my patience tried with him, I was obliged to send
him away, as he knew nothing about Hindustani. I was
exceedingly puzzled to know how I should ever be able to
acquire any assistance in learning these languages. Alas!
what trials are awaiting me. Sickness and the climate
have increased the irritability of my temper, and occasions
of trying it occur constantly. In the afternoon, while
pleading for a contrite tender spirit, but in vain, I was
obliged to cease praying for that tenderness of spirit, and
to go on to other petitions, and by this means was brought
to a more submissive state. Officiated at evening worship.</p>

<p><i>June 15.</i>&mdash;Found my mouth salivated this morning
from calomel. Attended the morning service at the mission-house;
Mr. Marsdon preached. After service Marshman
and Carey talked with me in the usual cheering way about
missionary things, but my mind was dark. In the afternoon
was rather more comfortable in prayer, and at evening
worship was assisted to go through the duties of it with
cheerfulness. Read some of Whitfield&rsquo;s <i>Sermons</i>.</p>

<p><i>June 19.</i>&mdash;Rose in gloom, but that was soon dissipated
by consideration and prayer. Began after breakfast for
the first time with a moonshi, a Cashmerian Brahmin,
with whom I was much pleased. In the boat, back to
Serampore, learning roots. Officiated at evening worship.
Walked at night with Marshman and Mr. Brown to the
bazaar held at this time of the year, for the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
people assembling at Juggernaut. The booth or carriage
was fifty feet high, in appearance a wooden temple, with
rows of wheels through the centre of it. By the side of
this a native brother who attended Marshman gave away
papers, and this gave occasion to disputes, which continued
a considerable time between Marshman and the Brahmins.
Felt somewhat hurt at night at <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;s insinuating that my
low spirits, as he called it, was owing to want of diligence.
God help me to be free from this charge, and yet not
desirous to make a show before men. May I walk in
sweet and inward communion with Him, labouring with
never-ceasing diligence and care, and assured that I shall
not live or labour in vain.</p>

<p><i>June 24.</i>&mdash;At daylight left Calcutta, and had my temper
greatly exercised by the neglects and improper behaviour
of the servants and boatmen. Arrived at Serampore at
eight, and retired to my pagoda, intending to spend the
day in fasting and prayer; but after a prayer in which the
Lord helped me to review with sorrow the wickedness of
my past life, I was so overcome with fatigue that I fell
asleep, and thus lost the whole morning; so I gave up my
original intention. Passed the afternoon in translating the
second chapter of St. Matthew into Hindustani. Had a
long conversation at night with Marshman, whose desire
now is that I should stay at Serampore, give myself to the
study of Hindustani for the sake of the Scriptures, and
be ready to supply the place of Carey and Marshman in
the work, should they be taken off; and for another reason&mdash;that
I might awaken the attention of the people of God
in Calcutta more to missionary subjects. I was struck
with the importance of having proper persons here to
supply the place of these two men; but could not see that
it was the path God designed for me. I felt, however, a
most impatient desire that some of my friends should come
out and give themselves to the work; for which they are
so much more fit in point of learning than any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Dissenters are, and could not bear that a work of such
stupendous magnitude should be endangered by their neglect
and love of the world. Marshman recommended that
the serious people in Calcutta should unite in a society for
the support of missions, and each subscribe fifty rupees a
month for their maintenance. Ten members with this
subscription could support sixty or seventy native brethren.
He wished me also to see the duty of their all remaining
in the country, learning the language, and instructing their
servants. My mind was so filled and excited by the first
part of our conversation, that I could not sleep for many
hours after going to bed. He told me that the people were
surfeited with the Gospel, and that they needed to be
exhorted to duty.</p>

<p><i>June 26.</i>&mdash;Employed in translating St. Matthew into
Hindustani, and reading Mirza&rsquo;s translation; afterwards
had moonshi a little. In the afternoon walked with Mr.
Brown to see Juggernaut&rsquo;s car drawn back to its pagoda.
Many thousands of people were present, rending the air
with acclamations. The car with the tower was decorated
with a vast number of flags, and the Brahmins were passing
to and fro through the different compartments of it,
catching the offerings of fruit, cowries, &amp;c., that were
thrown up to the god, for which they threw down in return
small wreaths of flowers, which the people wore round
their necks and in their hair. When the car stopped at
the pagoda, the god and two attending deities were let
down by ropes, muffled up in red cloths, a band of singers
with drums and cymbals going round the car while this
was performed. Before the stumps of images, for they
were not better, some of the people prostrated themselves,
striking the ground twice with their foreheads; this excited
more horror in me than I can well express, and I
was about to stammer out in Hindustani, &lsquo;Why do ye
these things?&rsquo; and to preach the Gospel. The words were
on my lips&mdash;though if I had spoken thousands would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
crowded round me, and I should not have been understood.
However, I felt my spirit more inflamed with zeal than I
ever conceived it would be; and I thought that if I had
words I would preach to the multitudes all the day, if I
lost my life for it. It was curious how the women clasped
their hands, and lifted them up as if in the ecstasy of devotion,
while Juggernaut was tumbled about in the most
clumsy manner before their eyes. I thought with some
sorrow that Satan may exert the same influence in exciting
apparently religious affections in professors of the Gospel,
in order to deceive souls to their eternal ruin. Dr. Taylor
and Mr. Moore joined us, and distributed tracts. Mr.
Ward, we heard, was at a distance preaching. On our
return we met Marshman going upon the same errand.
In evening worship my heart was rather drawn out for the
heathen, and my soul in general through the day enjoyed
a cheering sense of God&rsquo;s love. Marshman joined us
again, and our conversation was about supporting some
native missions.</p>

<p><i>June 30.</i>&mdash;Went up to Serampore in the boat, learning
roots. Spent the afternoon chiefly in prayer, of which my
soul stood greatly in need through the snares into which
my heart had been falling. Called at the mission-house,
and saw Mr. Marsdon previous to the commencement of
his missionary career. Now the plans of God are, I trust,
taking another step forward.</p>

<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;Mr. Brown proposed a prayer meeting between
ourselves and the missionaries previous to the departure
of Dr. Taylor for Surat. It was a season of grace to
my soul, for some sense of the vast importance of the
occasion dwelt upon my mind in prayer, and I desired
earnestly to live zealously, labouring for souls in every
possible way, with more honesty and openness. In the
evening went to Marshman, and proposed it. There were
at his house many agreeable sights; one pundit was
translating Scripture into Sanskrit, another into Guzerati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and a table was covered with materials for a Chinese
dictionary. Employed with moonshi in Hindu Story-teller,
and in learning to write the Persian characters.</p>

<p><i>July 3.</i>&mdash;Rose with some happiness in my soul, and
delight in the thought of an increase of labour in the
Church of God. Employed morning as usual, and in
thinking of subject for sermon. Was detained in the
house at a time when I wanted prayer. In the evening
walked with the family through Serampore, the native&rsquo;s
part. At night we had a delightful spiritual conversation.
Thus my time passes most agreeably in this dear family.
Lord, let me be willing to leave it and the world with joy.</p>

<p><i>July 8.</i>&mdash;Reading with moonshi all the morning.
Spent the afternoon in reading and prayer, as preparatory
to a meeting of the missionaries at night. At eight, ten
of us met in my pagoda. It was, throughout, a soul-refreshing
ordinance to me. I felt as I wished, as if having
done with the world, and standing on the very verge of
heaven, rejoicing at the glorious work which God will
accomplish on the earth. The Lord will, I hope, hear our
prayers for our dear brother, on whose account we met,
previous to his departure for Surat. An idea thrown out
by Carey pleased me very much, not on account of its
practicability, but its grandeur, <i>i.e.</i> that there should be an
annual meeting, at the Cape of Good Hope, of all the
missionaries in the world.</p>

<p><i>July 9.</i>&mdash;Dull and languid from the exertions and late
hours of yesterday. Reading the Sermon on the Mount,
in the Hindustani Testament, with moonshi. In the
evening went to the mission-house, drank tea, and attended
their worship. These affectionate souls never fail to
mention me particularly in their prayers, but I am grieved
that they so mistake my occasional warmth for zeal. It
is one of the things in which I am most low and backward,
as the Lord, who seeth in secret, knows too well. Oh,
then, may any who think it worth while to take up my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
name into their lips, pray for the beginning rather than the
continuance of zeal! Marshman, in my walk with him,
kindly assured me of his great regard and union of heart
with me. I would that I had more gratitude to God, for
so putting it into the hearts of His people to show regard
to one so undeserving of it. At night had much nearness
to God in prayer. I found it sweet to my spirit to reflect
on my being a pilgrim on earth, with Christ for my near
and dear friend, and found myself unwilling to leave off
my prayer.</p>

<p><i>July 10.</i>&mdash;Employed during the morning with moonshi.
At morning and evening worship enjoyed freedom of access
to God in prayer. Mr. Brown&rsquo;s return in the evening, with
another Christian friend, added greatly to my pleasure.
Marshman joined us at night, but these enjoyments, from
being too eagerly entered into, often leave my soul carnally
delighted only, instead of bringing me nearer to God.
Wrote sermon at night.</p>

<p><i>July 12.</i>&mdash;Most of this morning employed about sermon.
In the afternoon went down to Calcutta with Mr. Brown
and all his family; we passed the time very agreeably in
singing hymns. Found Europe letters on our arrival, but
were disappointed in not finding Corrie or Parson in the
list of passengers. My letters were from Lydia, T.H. and
Emma, Mr. Simeon, and Sargent. All their first letters
had been taken in the Bell Packet. I longed to see
Lydia&rsquo;s, but the Lord saw it good, no doubt, not to suffer
it to arrive. The one I did receive from her was very
animating, and showed the extraordinary zeal and activity
of her mind. Mr. Simeon&rsquo;s letter contained her praises,
and even he seemed to regret that I had gone without her.
My thoughts were so occupied with these letters that I
could get little or no sleep.</p>

<p><i>July 13.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Talked to Mr. Brown about
Lydia, and read her letter to him. He strongly recommended
the measure of endeavouring to bring her here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and was clear that my future situation in the country would
be such as to make it necessary to be married. A letter
from Colonel Sandys, which he opened afterwards, spoke
in the highest terms of her. The subject of marriage was
revived in my mind, but I feel rather a reluctance to it.
I enjoy in general such sweet peace of mind, from considering
myself a stranger upon earth, unconnected with
any persons, unknown, forgotten, that were I never thrown
into any more trying circumstances than I am in at present,
no change could add to my happiness. At the new church
this morning, had the happiness of hearing Mr. Jefferies
preach. I trust God will graciously keep him, and instruct
him, and make him another witness of Jesus in this place.
My heart was greatly refreshed, and rejoiced at it all the
day. At night preached at the missionary church, on
Eph. ii. 1-3, to a small congregation. Sat up late with
Mr. Brown, considering the same subject as we had been
conversing on before, and it dwelt so much on my mind
that I got hardly any sleep the whole night.</p>

<p><i>July 14.</i>&mdash;The same subject engrosses my whole thoughts.
Mr. Brown&rsquo;s arguments appear so strong that my mind is
almost made up to send for Lydia. I could scarcely have
any reasonable doubts remaining, that her presence would
most abundantly promote the ends of the mission.</p>

<p><i>July 15.</i>&mdash;Most of the day with moonshi; at intervals,
thinking on subject for sermon. My affections seemed to
be growing more strong towards Lydia than I could wish,
as I fear my judgment will no longer remain unbiassed.
The subject is constantly on my mind, and imagination
heightens the advantages to be obtained from her presence.
And yet, on the other hand, there is such a sweet happiness
in living unconnected with any creature, and hastening
through this life with not one single attraction to detain
my desires here, that I am often very unwilling to exchange
a life of celibacy for one of which I know nothing, except
that it is in general a life of care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 16.</i>&mdash;Morning with moonshi; afterwards preparing
myself for church. Preached at night, at missionary
church, on Isa. lxiii. 1. Both in prayers and sermon I
felt my heart much more affected than I expected, and there
seemed to be some impression on a few of the people. I feel
to be thankful to God, and grateful to the people, that they
continue to hear me with such attention. My thoughts this
day have been rather averse to marriage. Anxiety about
the education and conversion of children rather terrifies me.</p>

<p><i>July 20.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached at the new church on
2 Cor. v. 17. Mr. Marshman dined with us, and at four
I went to the bazaar, to hear him preach to the natives.
I arrived at the shed before him, and found the native
brethren singing, after which one of them got up, and addressed
the people with such firmness and mild energy,
notwithstanding their occasional contradictions and ridicule,
that I was quite delighted and refreshed. To see a native
Indian an earnest advocate for Jesus, how precious!
Marshman afterwards came, and prayed, sung, and preached.
If I were to be very severe with him, I should say that
there is a want of seriousness, tenderness, and dignity in
his address, and I felt pained that he should so frequently
speak with contempt of the Brahmins, many of whom
were listening with great respect and attention. The group
presented all that variety of countenance which the Word
is represented as producing in a heathen audience&mdash;some
inattentive, others scornful, and others seemingly melting
under it. Another native brother, I believe, then addressed
them. An Indian sermon about Jesus Christ was like
music on my ear, and I felt inflamed to begin my work:
these poor people possess more intelligence and feeling
than I thought. At the end of the service there was a
sort of uproar when the papers were given away, and the
attention of the populace and of some Europeans was
excited. Read prayers at night at the missionary church;
Mr. Brown preached on the unspeakable gift.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 21.</i>&mdash;Returned to Serampore rather in a low state
of mind, arising from deprivation of a society of which I
had been too fond.</p>

<p><i>July 22.</i>&mdash;Read Hindustani without moonshi. Not
being able to get to the pagoda from the incessant rain, I
passed the latter part of the day in the house, reading the
life of Francis Xavier. I was exceedingly roused at the
astonishing example of that great saint, and began to
consider whether it was not my duty to live, as he did, in
voluntary poverty and celibacy. I was not easy till I had
determined to follow the same course, when I should perceive
that the kingdom of God would be more advanced
by it. At night I saw the awful necessity of being no
longer slothful, nor wasting my thoughts about such trifles
as whether I should be married or not, and felt a great
degree of fear, lest the blood of the five thousand Mohammedans,
who, Mr. Brown said, were to be found in
Calcutta capable of understanding a Hindustani sermon,
should be required at my hand.</p>

<p><i>July 25.</i>&mdash;The thought of the Mohammedans and
heathens lies very heavy upon my mind. The former, who
are in Calcutta, I seem to think are consigned to me by God,
because nobody preaches in Hindustani. Employed the
morning in sermon and Hindustani. In the afternoon
went down to Calcutta. In the boat read Wrangham&rsquo;s
Essay and some of Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s letters, when young. What
knowledge have some believers of the deep things of God!
I felt myself peculiarly deficient in that experimental
knowledge of Christ with which Mr. Lloyd was particularly
favoured. Walked from the landing-place, a mile and a
half, through the native part of Calcutta, amidst crowds of
Orientals of all nations. How would the spirit of St. Paul
have been moved! The thought of summoning the attention
of such multitudes appeared very formidable, and
during the course of the evening was the occasion of many
solemn thoughts and prayer, that God would deliver me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
from all softness of mind, fear, and self-indulgence, and
make me ready to suffer shame and death for the name
of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p><i>July 26.</i>&mdash;My soul in general impressed with the
awfulness of my missionary work, and often shrinking
from its difficulties.</p>

<p><i>July 28.</i>&mdash;In the boat to Serampore we read Mitchell&rsquo;s
Essay on <i>Evangelizing India</i>, and were much pleased and
profited. Whatever plans and speculations may be agitated,
I felt it my duty to think only of putting my hand to the
work without delay. Felt very unhappy at having other
work put upon me, which will keep me from making
progress in the language. Nothing but waiting upon God
constantly for direction, and an assurance that His never-ceasing
love will direct my way, would keep me from
constant vexation. I scarcely do anything in the language,
from having my time so constantly taken up with writing
sermons.</p>

<p><i>July 29.</i>&mdash;Much of this morning taken up in writing to
Lydia. As far as my own views extend, I feel no doubt
at all about the propriety of the measure&mdash;of at least proposing
it. May the Lord, in continuance of His loving-kindness
to her and me, direct her mind, that if she comes
I may consider it as a special gift from God, and not
merely permitted by Him. Marshman sat with us in the
evening, and as usual was teeming with plans for the
propagation of the Gospel. Stayed up till midnight in
finishing the letter to Lydia.</p>

<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Lydia Grenfell</span></p>
<p class="date">
Serampore: July 30, 1806.
</p>

<p>My dearest Lydia,&mdash;On a subject so intimately connected
with my happiness and future ministry, as that on
which I am now about to address you, I wish to assure you
that I am not acting with precipitancy, or without much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
consideration and prayer, while I at last sit down to request
you to come out to me to India.</p>

<p>May the Lord graciously direct His blind and erring
creature, and not suffer the natural bias of his mind to
lead him astray. You are acquainted with much of the
conflict I have undergone on your account. It has been
greater than you or Emma have imagined, and yet not so
painful as I deserve to have found it for having suffered
my affections to fasten so inordinately on an earthly
object.</p>

<p>Soon, however, after my final departure from Europe,
God in great mercy gave me deliverance, and favoured
me throughout the voyage with peace of mind, indifference
about all worldly connections, and devotedness to no
object upon earth but the work of Christ. I gave you up
entirely&mdash;not the smallest expectation remained in my
mind of ever seeing you again till we should meet in
heaven: and the thought of this separation was the less
painful from the consolatory persuasion that our own
Father had so ordered it for our mutual good. I continued
from that time to remember you in my prayers only as a
Christian sister, though one very dear to me. On my arrival
in this country I saw no reason at first for supposing that
marriage was advisable for a missionary&mdash;or rather the
subject did not offer itself to my mind. The Baptist
missionaries indeed recommended it, and Mr. Brown; but
not knowing any proper person in this country, they were
not very pressing upon the subject, and I accordingly
gave no attention to it. After a very short experience and
inquiry afterwards, my own opinions began to change, and
when a few weeks ago we received your welcome letter,
and others from Mr. Simeon and Colonel Sandys, both of
whom spoke of you in reference to me, I considered it even
as a call from God to satisfy myself fully concerning His
will. From the account which Mr. Simeon received of
you from Mr. Thomason, he seemed in his letter to me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
regret that he had so strongly dissuaded me from thinking
about you at the time of my leaving England. Colonel
Sandys spoke in such terms of you, and of the advantages
to result from your presence in this country, that Mr.
Brown became very earnest for me to endeavour to prevail
upon you. Your letter to me perfectly delighted him, and
induced him to say that you would be the greatest aid to
the mission I could possibly meet with. I knew my own
heart too well not to be distrustful of it, especially as my
affections were again awakened, and accordingly all my
labour and prayer have been to check their influence, that
I might see clearly the path of duty.</p>

<p>Though I dare not say that I am under no bias, yet
from every view of the subject I have been able to take,
after balancing the advantages and disadvantages that
may ensue to the cause in which I am engaged, always in
prayer for God&rsquo;s direction, my reason is fully convinced of
the expediency, I had almost said the necessity, of having
you with me. It is possible that my reason may still be
obscured by passion; let it suffice, however, to say that
now with a safe conscience and the enjoyment of the
Divine presence, I calmly and deliberately make the proposal
to you&mdash;and blessed be God if it be not His will to
permit it; still this step is not advancing beyond the limits
of duty, because there is a variety of ways by which God
can prevent it, without suffering any dishonour to His
cause. If He shall forbid it, I think that, by His grace, I
shall even then be contented and rejoice in the pleasure
of corresponding with you. Your letter, dated December
1805, was the first I received (your former having been
taken in the Bell Packet), and I found it so animating
that I could not but reflect on the blessedness of having so
dear a counsellor always near me. I can truly say, and
God is my witness, that my principal desire in this affair
is that you may promote the kingdom of God in my own
heart, and be the means of extending it to the heathen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
My own earthly comfort and happiness are not worth a
moment&rsquo;s notice. I would not, my dearest Lydia, influence
you by any artifices or false representations. I can only
say that if you have a desire of being instrumental in
establishing the blessed Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom among these
poor people, and will condescend to do it by supporting
the spirits and animating the zeal of a weak messenger of
the Lord, who is apt to grow very dispirited and languid,
&lsquo;Come, and the Lord be with you!&rsquo; It can be nothing
but a sacrifice on your part, to leave your valuable friends
to come to one who is utterly unworthy of you or any
other of God&rsquo;s precious gifts: but you will have your
reward, and I ask it not of you or of God for the sake of
my own happiness, but only on account of the Gospel. If
it be not calculated to promote it, may God in His mercy
withhold it. For the satisfaction of your friends, I should
say that you will meet with no hardships. The voyage is
very agreeable, and with the people and country of India
I think you will be much pleased. The climate is very
fine&mdash;the so much dreaded heat is really nothing to those
who will employ their minds in useful pursuits. Idleness
will make people complain of everything. The natives
are the most harmless and timid creatures I ever met with.
The whole country is the land of plenty and peace. Were
I a missionary among the Esquimaux or Boschemen, I
should never dream of introducing a female into such a
scene of danger or hardship, especially one whose happiness
is dearer to me than my own: but here there is
universal tranquillity, though the multitudes are so great
that a missionary needs not go three miles from his house
without having a congregation of many thousands. You
would not be left in solitude if I were to make any distant
excursion, because no chaplain is stationed where there is
not a large English Society. My salary is abundantly
sufficient for the support of a married man, the house and
number of people kept by each Company&rsquo;s servant being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
such as to need no increase for a family establishment.
As I must make the supposition of your coming, though
it may be perhaps a premature liberty, I should give you
some directions. This letter will reach you about the
latter end of the year; it would be very desirable if you
could be ready for the February fleet, because the voyage
will be performed in far less time than at any other season.
George will find out the best ship&mdash;one in which there is
a lady of high rank in the service would be preferable.
You are to be considered as coming as a visitor to Mr.
Brown, who will write to you or to Colonel Sandys, who
is best qualified to give you directions about the voyage.
Should I be up the country on your arrival in Bengal, Mr.
Brown will be at hand to receive you, and you will find
yourself immediately at home. As it will highly expedite
some of the plans which we have in agitation that you
should know the language as soon as possible, take
Gilchrist&rsquo;s <i>Indian Stranger&rsquo;s Guide</i>, and occasionally on
the voyage learn some of the words.</p>

<p>If I had room I might enlarge on much that would be
interesting to you. In my conversations with Marshman,
the Baptist missionary, our hearts sometimes expand with
delight and joy at the prospect of seeing all these nations
of the East receive the doctrine of the Cross. He is a
happy labourer; and I only wait, I trust, to know the
language to open my mouth boldly and make known the
mystery of the Gospel. My romantic notions are for
the first time almost realised; for in addition to the
beauties of sylvan scenery may be seen the more delightful
object of multitudes of simple people sitting in the shade
listening to the words of eternal life. Much as yet is not
done; but I have seen many discover by their looks while
Marshman was preaching that their hearts were tenderly
affected. My post is not yet determined; we expect, however,
it will be Patna, a civil station, where I shall not be
under military command. As you are so kindly anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
about my health, I am happy to say, that through mercy
my health is far better than it ever was in England.</p>

<p>The people of Calcutta are very desirous of keeping
me at the mission-church, and offer to any Evangelical
clergyman a chaplain&rsquo;s salary and a house besides. I am
of course deaf to such a proposal; but it is strange that
no one in England is <i>tempted</i> by such an inviting situation.
I am actually going to mention it to Cousin T.H. and
Emma&mdash;not, as you may suppose, with much hope of
success; but I think that possibly the chapel at Dock may
be too much for him, and he will have here a sphere of
still greater importance. As this will be sent by the
overland despatch, there is some danger of its not reaching
you. You will therefore receive a duplicate, and perhaps
a triplicate by the ships that will arrive in England a
month or two after. I cannot write now to any of my
friends. I will therefore trouble you, if you have opportunity,
to say that I have received no letters since I left
England, but one from each of these&mdash;Cousin Tom and
Emma, Simeon, Sargent, Bates: of my own family I have
heard nothing. Assure any of them whom you may see
of the continuance of my affectionate regard, especially
dear Emma. I did not know that it was permitted me to
write to you, or I fear she would not have found me so
faithful a correspondent on the voyage. As I have heretofore
addressed you through her, it is probable that I may
be now disposed to address her through you&mdash;or, what will
be best of all, that we both of us address her in one letter
from India. However, you shall decide, my dearest Lydia.
I <i>must</i> approve your determination, because with that spirit
of simple-looking to the Lord which we both endeavour
to maintain, we must not doubt that you will be divinely
directed. Till I receive an answer to this, my prayers you
may be assured will be constantly put up for you that in
this affair you may be under an especial guidance, and that
in all your ways God may be abundantly glorified by you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
through Jesus Christ. You say in your letter that <i>frequently
every day</i> you remember my worthless name before the
throne of grace. This instance of extraordinary and
undeserved kindness draws my heart toward you with a
tenderness which I cannot describe. Dearest Lydia, in
the sweet and fond expectation of your being given to me
by God, and of the happiness which I humbly hope you
yourself might enjoy here, I find a pleasure in breathing
out my assurance of ardent love. I have now long loved
you most affectionately, and my attachment is more strong,
more pure, more heavenly, because I see in you the image
of Jesus Christ. I unwillingly conclude, by bidding my
beloved Lydia adieu.</p>

<p>My dearest Lydia,&mdash;With this you will receive the duplicate
of the letter I sent you a month ago, by the overland
despatch. May it find you prepared to come! All the
thoughts and views which I have had of the subject since
first addressing you, add tenfold confirmation to my first
opinion; and I trust that the blessed God will graciously
make it appear that I have been acting under a right
direction, by giving the precious gift to me and to the
Church in India. I sometimes regret that I had not
obtained a promise from you of following me at the time
of our last parting at Gurlyn, as I am occasionally apt to
be excessively impatient at the long delay. Many, many
months must elapse before I can see you or even hear how
you shall determine. The instant your mind is made up
you will send a letter by the overland despatch. George
will let you know how it is to be prepared, as the Company
have given some printed directions. It is a consolation to
me during this long suspense, that had I engaged with
you before my departure I should not have had such a
satisfactory conviction of it being the will of God. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Commander-in-chief is in doubt to which of the three
following stations he shall appoint me&mdash;Benares, Patna,
or Moorshedabad; it will be the last, most probably. This
is only two days&rsquo; journey from Calcutta. I shall take my
departure in about six weeks. In the hour that remains, I
must endeavour to write to my dear sister Emma, and to
Sally. By the fleet which will sail hence in about two
months, they will receive longer letters. You will then, I
hope, have left England. I am very happy here in
preparing for my delightful work, but I should be happier
still if I were sufficiently fluent in the language to be
actually employed; and happiest of all if my beloved
Lydia were at my right hand, counselling and animating
me. I am not very willing to end my letter to you; it is
difficult not to prolong the enjoyment of speaking, as it
were, to one who occupies so much of my sleeping and
waking hours; but here, alas! I am aware of danger; and
my dear Lydia will, I hope, pray that her unworthy friend
may love no creature inordinately.</p>

<p>It will be base in me to depart in heart from a God of
such love as I find Him to be. Oh, that I could make
some returns for the riches of His love! Swiftly fly the
hours of life away, and then we shall be admitted to
behold His glory. The ages of darkness are rolling fast
away, and shall soon usher in the Gospel period when the
whole world shall be filled with His glory. Oh, my beloved
sister and friend, dear to me on every account, but dearest
of all for having one heart and one soul with me in the
cause of Jesus and the love of God, let us pray and rejoice,
and rejoice and pray, that God may be glorified, and the
dying Saviour see of the travail of His soul. May the God
of hope fill us with all joy and peace in believing, that we
may both of us abound in hope through the power of the
Holy Ghost. Now, my dearest Lydia, I cannot say what
I feel&mdash;I cannot pour out my soul&mdash;I could not if you
were here; but I pray that you may love me, if it be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
will of God; and I pray that God may make you more and
more His child, and give me more and more love for all
that is God-like and holy. I remain, with fervent affection,</p>

Calcutta: September 1, 1806.
</p>

<p>My dearest Brother,&mdash;I feel no hesitation about inviting
Miss L.G. on her own account, except it be that she should
come so far for one who is so utterly unworthy of her. I
would rather die than bring one whom I honour so much
into a situation of difficulty; but indeed there is no hardship
to be encountered. In my absence she might, if she
pleased, visit the English ladies who are always to be found
at the different stations. The plan about to be adopted
by the Baptists is to establish missionary stations in the
country; while one missionary makes the circuit of the
surrounding country, another shall always be in the way
to receive enquiries and to explain. I should think that a
zealous woman, acquainted with the language, and especially
if assisted by native brethren, might be of use in this
way without moving from her house.... Three such men
as Carey, Marshman, and Ward, so suited to one another
and to their work, are not to be found, I should think, in
the whole world.</p>

<p><i>September 13.</i>&mdash;Heard of the arrival of Corrie and
Parson at Madras, and of my appointment to Dinapore.</p>

<p><i>September 15.</i>&mdash;Called with Mr. Brown on Mr. Udny,
then went up with him to Serampore, and passed much of
the afternoon in reading with him a series of newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
from England. How affecting to think how the fashion
of this world passeth away! What should I do without
Christ as an everlasting portion! How vain is life, how
mournful is death, and what is eternity without Christ!
In the evening Marshman and Ward came to us. By
endeavouring to recollect myself as before God, I found
more comfort, and was enabled to show more propriety in
conversation.</p>

<p><i>September 16.</i>&mdash;Passed the day with moonshi in
Hindustani and writing sermon. In the evening wrote to
Lydia.</p>

<p><i>September 17.</i>&mdash;The blaze of a funeral pile this morning
near the pagoda drew my attention. I ran out, but the
unfortunate woman had committed herself to the flames
before I arrived. The remains of the two bodies were
visible. At night, while I was at the missionaries&rsquo;, Mr.
Chamberlain arrived from up the country. Just as we rejoiced
at the thought of seeing him and his wife, we found
she had died in the boat! I do not know when I was so
shocked; my soul revolted at everything in this world,
which God has so marked with misery&mdash;the effect of sin.
I felt reluctance to engage in every worldly connection.
Marriage seemed terrible, by exposing one to the agonising
sight of a wife dying in such circumstances.</p>

<p><i>September 24.</i>&mdash;Went down to Calcutta with Mr. Brown
and Corrie, and found letters. My affections of love and
joy were so excited by them that it was almost too much
for my poor frame. My dearest Lydia&rsquo;s assurances of her
love were grateful enough to my heart, but they left
somewhat of a sorrowful effect, occasioned I believe chiefly
from a fear of her suffering in any degree, and partly from
the long time and distance that separate us, and uncertainty
if ever we shall be permitted to meet one another in this
world. In the evening the Lord gave me near and close
and sweet communion with Him on this subject, and
enabled me to commit the affair with comfort into His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
hands. Why did I ever doubt His love? Does He not
love us far better than we love one another?</p>

<p><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;Went to Serampore with Mr. Brown
and Parson; in the afternoon read with moonshi; enjoyed
much of the solemn presence of God the whole day, had
many happy seasons in prayer, and felt strengthened for
the work of a missionary, which is speedily to begin;
blessed be God! My friends are alarmed about the solitariness
of my future life, and my tendency to melancholy;
but, O my dearest Lord! Thou art with me, Thy rod and
Thy staff they comfort me. I go on Thine errand, and I
know that Thou art and wilt be with me. How easily canst
Thou support and refresh my heart!</p>

<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Lydia Grenfell</span></p>
<p class="date">
Serampore: September 1806.
</p>

<p>How earnestly do I long for the arrival of my dearest
Lydia! Though it may prove at last no more than a
waking dream that I ever expected to receive you in India,
the hope is too pleasing not to be cherished till I am
forbidden any longer to hope. Till I am assured of the
contrary, I shall find a pleasure in addressing you as my
own. If you are not to be mine you will pardon me; but
my expectations are greatly encouraged by the words you
used when we parted at Gurlyn, that I had better <i>go out</i>
free, implying, as I thought, that you would not be unwilling
to follow me if I should see it to be the will of God to make
the request. I was rejoiced also to see in your letter that
you unite your name with mine when you pray that God
would keep us both in the path of duty: from this I infer
that you are by no means <i>determined</i> to remain separate
from me. You will not suppose, my dear Lydia, that I
mention these little things to influence your conduct, or to
implicate you in an engagement. No, I acknowledge that
you are perfectly free, and I have no doubt that you will
act as the love and wisdom of our God shall direct. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
heart is far less interested in this business than mine, in all
probability; and this on one account I do not regret, as
you will be able to see more clearly the directions of God&rsquo;s
providence. About a fortnight ago I sent you a letter
accompanying the duplicate of the one sent overland in
August. If these shall have arrived safe you will perhaps
have left England before this reaches it. But if not, let me
entreat you to delay not a moment. Yet how will my dear
sister Emma be able to part with you, and George&mdash;but
above all your <i>mother</i>? I feel very much for you and for
them, but I have no doubt at all about your health and
happiness in this country.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-chief has at last appointed me to
the station of Dinapore, near Patna, and I shall accordingly
take my departure for that place as soon as I can make
the necessary preparations. It is not exactly the situation
I wished for, though in a temporal point of view it is
desirable enough. The air is good, the living cheap, the
salary 1,000<i>l.</i> a year, and there is a large body of English
troops there. But I should have preferred being near
Benares, the heart of Hinduism. We rejoice to hear that
two other brethren are arrived at Madras on their way to
Bengal, sent, I trust, by the Lord to co-operate in overturning
the kingdom of Satan in these regions. They are
Corrie and Parson, both Bengal chaplains. Their stations
will be Benares and Moorshedabad&mdash;one on one side of
me and the other on the other. There are also now ten
Baptist missionaries at Serampore. Surely good is intended
for this country.</p>

<p>Captain Wickes, the good old Captain Wickes, who has
brought out so many missionaries to India, is now here.
He reminds me of Uncle S. I have been just interrupted
by the blaze of a funeral pile, within a hundred yards of
my pagoda. I ran out, but the wretched woman had consigned
herself to the flames before I reached the spot, and
I saw only the remains of her and her husband. O Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
how long shall it be? Oh, I shall have no rest in my
spirit till my tongue is loosed to testify against the Devil,
and deliver the message of God to these His unhappy bond-slaves.
I stammered out something to the wicked Brahmins
about the judgments of God upon them for the murder
they had just committed, but they said it was an act of her
own free-will. Some of the missionaries would have been
there, but they are forbidden by the Governor-General to
preach to the natives in the British territory. Unless this
prohibition is revoked by an order from home it will
amount to a total suppression of the mission.</p>

<p>I know of nothing else that will give you a further idea
of the state of things here. The two ministers continue to
oppose my doctrines with unabated virulence; but they
think not that they fight against God. My own heart is at
present cold and slothful. Oh, that my soul did burn with
love and zeal! Surely were you here I should act with
more cheerfulness and activity with so bright a pattern
before me. If Corrie brings me a letter from you, and the
fleet is not sailed, which, however, is not likely, I shall write
to you again. Colonel Sandys will receive a letter from
me and Mr. Brown by this fleet. Continue to remember
me in your prayers, as a weak brother. I shall always
think of you as one to be loved and honoured.</p>

<hr class="shorthr" />

<p><i>September 26.</i>&mdash;Employed as usual in Hindustani;
visited Marshman at night. He and Mr. Carey sat with us
in the evening. My heart still continuing some degree of
watchfulness, but enjoying less sweetness.</p>

<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;Reading with moonshi and preparing sermon;
found great cause to pray for brotherly love.
Preached at night at the mission-church on Eph. ii. 4.
Had a very refreshing conversation with Corrie afterwards;
we wished it to be for the benefit of two cadets, who supped
with us, and I hope it will not be in vain. May the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
be pleased to make me act with a single eye to His glory.
How easy it is to preach about Christ Jesus the Lord, and
yet to preach oneself.</p></div>

<p>None of six letters from Lydia Grenfell have been
preserved, but we find in her <i>Diary</i> more self-revealing of
her heart than could be made to Henry Martyn, and also
more severity in judging of herself as in the presence of
God.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, May 23.</i>&mdash;Wrote dear H. I have felt to-day a
return of spirits, but have spent them too much in worldly
things. I found it a blessed season in prayer, yet I fear
whether my satisfaction did not rather arise from being
enabled to pray than from any extraordinary communications
from above. O Lord, search and try my heart, let
not its deceitfulness impose on me.</p>

<p><i>July 19.</i>&mdash;Thought much this week of my dear absent
friend.</p>

<p><i>August 2.</i>&mdash;My family&rsquo;s unhappiness preys on my
mind&mdash;sister burning with anger and resentment against
sister, brother against brother, a father against his children.
Oh, what a picture! Let me not add to the weight of family
sin.</p>

<p><i>August 4.</i>&mdash;Passed a happy day. Read Baxter, and
found in doing so my soul raised above. Oh, let me have,
blessed Lord, anticipations of this blessedness and foretaste
of glory. In Thy presence above I shall be reunited to
Thy dear saint, now labouring in Thy vineyard in a distant
land. One year is nearly passed since we parted, but
scarcely a waking hour, I believe, has he been absent from
my mind. In general my remembrance of him is productive
of pleasure&mdash;that I should possess so large a share
of his affection, and be remembered in his prayers, and
have an eternity to spend with him, yielding me in turn
delightful pleasing meditations; but just now nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
grieves that we are no more to meet below; yet, O my
blessed Father, I cry, &lsquo;Thy will be done, not as I will, but
as Thou wilt.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>August 10.</i>&mdash;Went to church. My soul was very dull
and inanimate throughout the service&mdash;the sermon had
nothing in it to enliven or instruct. Barren as this place
is for other means of grace, I have the Word and leisure to
search; I cannot then complain, but of myself there is
cause enough. Oh, how is my soul so earthly? why cannot
I rise and dwell above? Tied and bound with the chain
of sin, fettered and confined, I can only cast a look above.
One year is gone since my dear friend left England. The
number of our years of separation is so much lessened, and
our salvation draws near.</p>

<p><i>October 19.</i>&mdash;My birthday. One-and-thirty years have
I existed on this earth, for twenty-five of which all the
amount was sin, vanity, and rebellion against God; the
last six, though spent differently, yet for every day in
them I am persuaded I have sinned in heart, so as
justly to merit condemnation of that God in whose mercy
I trust.</p>

<p><i>November 5.</i>&mdash;To-day I was reading of David&rsquo;s harp
driving away the evil spirit from Saul, and resolved again
(the Lord helping me) to try the sweet harp of Jesse&rsquo;s son
in my first and last waking thoughts, for sad and disordered
are my thoughts upon my friend. The expectation
of letters from my dear friend in India by this fleet is
almost over, and my mind is rendered anxious about him.</p>

<p><i>November 25.</i>&mdash;My very soul has been cheered by
accounts from my dear friend in India, for whom my
mind has been greatly anxious. &lsquo;Cast thy cares on Me&rsquo;
is a command badly attended to by me.</p></div>

<p>The formal and first request from Henry Martyn to
join him in India reached Lydia Grenfell on March 2, 1807.
We learn from his reply in October 1807, from Dinapore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that she had sent a refusal in her mother&rsquo;s name. But, on
April 25, the Rev. Charles Simeon called on her with the
result which he thus records:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With her mother&rsquo;s leave Miss G. accompanied us to
Col. Sandys&rsquo;, when I had much conversation with her
about Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s affair. She stated to me all the
obstacles to his proposals: first, her health; second, the
indelicacy of her going out to India alone on such an
errand; third, her former engagement with another person,
which had indeed been broken off, and he had actually
gone up to London two years ago to be married to another
woman, but, as he was unmarried, it seemed an obstacle
in her mind; fourth, the certainty that her mother would
never consent to it. On these points I observed that I
thought the last was the only one that was insurmountable;
for that, first, India often agreed best with persons of a delicate
constitution&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> Mr. Martyn himself and Mr. Brown.
Second, it is common for ladies to go thither without any
previous connection; how much more, therefore, might one
go with a connection already formed! Were this the only
difficulty, I engaged, with the help of Mr. Grant and Mr. Parry,
that she should go under such protection as should obviate
all difficulties upon this head. Third, the step taken by the
other person had set her at perfect liberty. Fourth, the
consent of her mother was indispensable, and as that
appeared impossible, the matter might be committed to
God in this way. If her mother, of her own accord, should
express regret that the connection had been prevented,
from an idea of her being irreconcilably averse to it, and
that she would not stand in the way of her daughter&rsquo;s
wishes, this would be considered as a direction from God
in answer to her prayers, and I should instantly be
apprised of it by her, in order to communicate to Mr. M.
<i>In this she perfectly agreed.</i> I told her, however, that I
would mention nothing of this to Mr. M., because it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
only tend to keep him in painful suspense. Thus the
matter is entirely set aside, unless God, by a special interposition
of His providence (<i>i.e.</i> by taking away her mother,
or overruling her mind, contrary to all reasonable expectation,
to approve of it), mark His own will concerning it.</p></div>

<p>We find this account of the crisis in her <i>Diary</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1807, March 2.</i>&mdash;Passed some peaceful happy days at
Tregembo. My return was marked by two events, long to be
remembered&mdash;seeing John and hearing from H.M. Great
has been my distress, but peace is returned, and could I cease
from anticipating future evils I should enjoy more. The
Lord has been gracious in affording me help, but He made
me first feel my weakness, and suffered Satan to harass
me. I am called upon now to act a decisive part.</p>

<p><i>Marazion, March 8.</i>&mdash;With David let me say, In the
multitude of thoughts within me Thy comforts have
refreshed my soul. O Thou! my refuge, my rest, my
hiding-place, in every time of sorrow to Thee I fly, and
trust in the covert of Thy wings. Thou hast been a
shelter for me and a strong tower. I have liberty to pour
out my griefs into the bosom of my God, and doing so I am
lightened of their burden. The Lord&rsquo;s dealings are singular
with me, yet not severe, yea, they are merciful. Twice
have I been called on to act<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> ... in a way few are
tried in, but the Lord&rsquo;s goodness towards me is so manifest
in the first, that I have come to wait in silence and hope
the event of this. I am satisfied I have done now what is
right, and peace has returned to me; yet there is need of
great watchfulness to resist the enemy of souls, who would
weaken and depress my soul, bringing to remembrance the
affection of my dear friend, and representing my conduct
as ungrateful towards him. To-day I have had many
distressing feelings on his account, yet in the general I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
have been looking to things invisible and eternal, and
therefore enjoyed peace. I must live more in the contemplation
of Christ and heavenly things. Oh, come, fill
and satisfy my soul, be my leader and guide, dispose of
me as Thou wilt. The pain of writing to him is over, and
I feel satisfied I wrote what duty required of me.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Now
then, return, O my soul, to thy rest.</p>

<p><i>March 22.</i>&mdash;A week of conflict and of mercies is over.
May the remembrance of Thy goodness never be forgotten.
I bless Thee, O my God, that Thou hast brought me
hitherto, and with more reason than David, inquire what
am I that Thou shouldest do so?</p>

<p><i>April 23.</i>&mdash;To-day my mind has been painfully affected
by the receipt of letters from <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>. I found in the presence
of my mother I dared not indulge the inclination I
feel to mourn; and believing my Heavenly Parent&rsquo;s will
to be that I should be careful for nothing, I ought to be
equally exerting myself in secret to resist the temptation.
How true it is we suffer more in the person of another dear
to us than in our own! Lord, I know Thou canst perfectly
satisfy him by the consolation of Thy Spirit and communications
of Thy grace; Thou canst display the glories
of Thy beloved Son to his view, and put gladness into his
heart. Oh, support, cheer, and bless him; let Thy left hand
be under his head, and Thy right hand embrace him, that
he may feel less than my fears suggest. Oh, do Thou
powerfully impress our minds with a persuasion of Thy
overruling hand in this trial. Let us see it to be Thy will,
and be now and ever disposed to bow to it. Uphold me,
Jesus, or I fan a prey to distracting thoughts and imagination.</p>

<p><i>April 24.</i>&mdash;The arrival of dear Mr. Simeon has been
a cordial to my fainting heart. Lord, do Thou comfort me
by him; none but Thyself can give me lasting comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>&mdash;instruments
are nothing without Thee. Oh, may I now be
watchful, for often, through my depraved nature, when
unlooked-for deliverance comes, I get careless and light
in my frame; then the Lord hides His face, and trouble
comes, which no outward circumstances can relieve. I
need especial direction from on high. Oh, may my dependence
be on the Lord, and I shall not go astray.</p>

<p><i>April 28.</i>&mdash;Went on Saturday with Mr. Simeon and
Mr. E. to Helston. Lord, I bless Thy holy name, I
adore Thy wonderful unmerited goodness towards such a
base, vile creature, that Thou shouldest at this particular
season send me counsel and support through the medium
of Thy dear servant. I am brought home again in safety,
and enjoyed, during my absence, an opportunity of seeing
how a Christian lives.</p>

<p><i>April 29.</i>&mdash;The state of my mind lately has led me to
fill too much of my <i>Diary</i> with expressions of regard for
an earthly object, and now I am convinced of the evil of
indulging this affection. Oh, may the Lord enable me to
mortify it; may this mirror of my heart show me more of
love to God and less to anything earthly. This morning
was a sad one, and to the present I have to mourn over
the barrenness of my soul, its indisposedness to any spiritual
exertion. Almost constantly do I remember my dear
absent friend; may I do so with less pain.</p>

<p><i>May 1.</i>&mdash;I begin this month in circumstances peculiarly
trying, such as I can support only by aid vouchsafed from
above, and sought in constant prayer. The Lord is a
stronghold in this time of trouble.</p>

<p><i>May 2.</i>&mdash;To-day and yesterday I have found more
composure of mind than of late; once indeed the enemy
(whose devices I am too ignorant of to meet them as I
ought) succeeded in distracting my mind, and excited
many sinful passions from the probability that Miss Corrie,
who is going to her brother, may be the partner appointed
for my dear friend. This continued for a short time only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and I found relief at a throne of grace. It is a subject I
must not dwell on&mdash;when the trial comes, grace will be
given; but at present I have none to meet it; yet have
I prayed the Lord to provide him a suitable helpmate.
Deceitful is my heart; how little do I know it! O Thou
bleeding Saviour, let me hide myself in Thee from deserved
wrath, and oh, speak peace once more to my soul.</p>

<p><i>May 3.</i>&mdash;A day of much sinful inquietude. Oh, that I
could withdraw my affections! Oh, that I could once more
feel I have no desire but after heavenly things! What a
chaos has my mind been to-day, even in the house of
God and at the throne of grace. I have been, in imagination,
conversing with a fellow-creature. Where is thy
heart? is a question not now to be answered satisfactorily.
Tied and bound with this chain, if for a little time I rise
to God, soon I turn from the glories of His face, grieving
His Spirit by preferring the ideal presence of my friend&mdash;sometimes
drawing the scene of his distress, at others the
pleasure of his return. Oh, let me not continue thus to walk
in the vanity of my mind. Oh, may I find sufficient happiness
in the presence of my God here, and live looking to
the things not seen, looking to that heavenly country
where I shall enjoy in perfection the blessed society and
(of?) all I loved below.</p>

<p><i>May 4.</i>&mdash;Passed a day of less conflict, though I have
very imperfectly kept my resolution not to indulge vain
improbable expectations of the future; yet I have been
favoured with a greater freedom from them than yesterday.</p>

<p><i>May 5.</i>&mdash;I have been suddenly to-day seized with a
violent depression of spirits and a sadness of heart, hard
to be concealed. I have not, as before, fallen into a long
train of vain imaginations, drawing scenes improbable and
vain, but my soul has lost its spiritual appetite. I am
looking forward to distant and uncertain events with
anticipations of sorrow and trial impending. O my Lord
and my God, come to my relief!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>May 9.</i>&mdash;Oh, what great troubles and adversities hast
Thou showed me, and yet Thou didst turn again and
refresh me! The whole of this day has been a dark and
exceedingly gloomy season, my mind tossed to and fro
like the tempestuous sea. I think the chief cause of my
distress arises from a dread of dishonouring the name of
the Lord, by appearing to have acted deceitfully in the
eyes of my family, and some pride is at the bottom of
this (I like not to be thought ill of), and also pain for the
disappointment my dear friend will soon know. His
situation grieves me infinitely more than my own. I
think, for myself, I want nothing more than I find in Thy
presence.</p>

<p><i>May 20.</i>&mdash;My chief concern now is lest I should have
given too much reason for my dear friend&rsquo;s hoping I might
yet be prevailed on to attend to his request, and I feel the
restraint stronger than ever, that, having before promised,
I am not free to marry. I paint the scene of his return,
and, whichever way I take, nothing but misery and guilt
seems to await me. Yet oh, I will continue to pray, &lsquo;Heal
me, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved.&rsquo;
Thou art my strength and hope, O Lord; though shame
is my portion among men. Thou who knowest my heart,
Thou wilt not in this condemn me, for oh, Thou knowest
these consequences of my regard for Thy dear saint were
not intended by me, and that first, when I regarded him
otherwise than as a Christian brother, I believed myself
free to do so, imagining him I first loved united to another.
When I consider this circumstance my mind is relieved of
a heavy burden, and yet I must lament the evils that have
flown from this mistake. My thoughts have been called
since Sunday into the eternal world by the sudden death
of a very kind friend, H.C. I have found this event,
though the cause of pain, very useful to me at this time.</p>

<p><i>May 22.</i>&mdash;The way Satan takes is made plain to me,
and I must resist him in the first pleasing ideas arising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
from the remembrance of true affection in my dear and
ever-esteemed friend. When I yield to these, I am
presently lost to all sober thoughts, and plunged soon in
the deepest sorrow for the distress it has brought on him;
then my conduct towards him and every part of my family
is painted in the most horrid colours, till I am nearly
distracted. Thus has Satan over and over oppressed me,
and relief been afforded my fainting soul through the help
of a superior power even than Satan. I must watch and
pray, for thus the Lord will bruise Satan under my feet.</p>

<p><i>August 6.</i>&mdash;This season recalls a dear friend to my
remembrance. Oh, may he occupy no more of my thoughts
and affections than is consistent with the will of God, and
pleasing in His sight. May these resignations be manifested
by us both.</p>

<p><i>August 9.</i>&mdash;Just two years since I parted from a dear
friend and brother, whose memory will ever be cherished
by me. Blessed be God! I feel now as if he was the
inhabitant of another world, rather than of another part
of this earth.</p></div>

<p>On October 10, 1806, on the close of his preparations for
departure to Dinapore, &lsquo;at night the missionaries, etc., met
us at the pagoda for the purpose of commending me to the
grace of God.&rsquo; &lsquo;My soul never yet had such Divine enjoyment.
I felt a desire to break from the body, and join the
high praises of the saints above.&rsquo; Next day, in Calcutta, at
evening worship at Mr. Myers&rsquo;, &lsquo;I found my heaven begun
on earth. No work so sweet as that of praying and living
wholly to the service of God.&rsquo; On Sunday, the 12th, &lsquo;at
night I took my leave of the saints in Calcutta in a sermon
on Acts xx. 32. But how very far from being in spirit
like the great apostle.&rsquo; On Monday he went up by land
to Barrackpore with Mr. Brown, &lsquo;happy in general.&rsquo; On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Tuesday &lsquo;Corrie came to me at the pagoda and prayed
with me.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, October 15.</i>&mdash;Took my leave of the family at
Aldeen in morning worship; but I have always found my
heart most unable to be tender and solemn when occasions
most require it. At eleven I set off in a budgerow with
Mr. Brown, Corrie, and Parson. Marshman saw us as we
passed the mission-house, and could not help coming aboard.
He dined with us, and after going on a little way left us
with a prayer. About sunset we landed at the house of the
former French governor, and walked five miles through
villages to Chandernagore, where we waited at an hotel till
the boats came up. With the French host I found a liberty
I could not have hoped for in his language, and was so
enabled to preach the Gospel to him. There are two Italian
monks in this place, who say Mass every day. I wished
much to visit the fathers, if there had been time. A person
of Calcutta, here for his health, troubled us with his
profaneness, but we did not let him go unwarned, nor kept
back the counsel of God. At night in the budgerow I
prayed with my dear brethren.</p>

<p><i>October 16.</i>&mdash;Rose somewhat dejected, and walked on
to Chinsurah, the Dutch settlement, about three miles.
There we breakfasted, and dined with Mr. Forsyth, the
missionary. We all enjoyed great happiness in the presence
and blessing of our God. Mr. Forsyth came on with us
from Chinsurah, till we stopped at sunset opposite Bandel,
a Portuguese settlement, and then we had Divine service.
I prayed and found my heart greatly enlarged. After his
departure our conversation was suitable and spiritual.
How sweet is prayer to my soul at this time! I seem as if
I never could be tired, not only of spiritual joys, but of
spiritual employments, since they are now the same.</p>

<p><i>October 17.</i>&mdash;My dear brethren, on account of the bad
weather, were obliged to leave me to-day. So we spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the whole morning in a Divine ordinance in which each
read a portion of Scripture and all sang and prayed. Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s passage, chosen from Joshua i., was very suitable,
&lsquo;Have I not commanded thee?&rsquo; Let this be an answer to
my fears, O my Lord, and an assurance that I am in Thy
work. It was a very affecting season to me. In prayer
I was very far from a state of seriousness and affection.
Indeed, I have often remarked that I have never yet
prayed comfortably with friends when it has been preceded
by a chapter of the Revelation. Perhaps because
I depend too much on the feelings which the imagery
of that book excites, instead of putting myself into the
hands of the Spirit, the only author of the prayer of faith.
They went away in their boat, and I was left alone for
the first time, with none but natives.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="subheading">DINAPORE AND PATNA, 1807-1809</p>


<p>Until, in 1852 and the ten years following, Lord Dalhousie&rsquo;s
railway up the Ganges valley was completed to
Allahabad, the usual mode of proceeding up-country from
Calcutta was by the house-boat known as the budgerow,
which is still common on the many rivers of Bengal where
English planters and officials are found. At the rate of
twenty-five miles a day the traveller is towed up against
stream by the boatmen. When time is no object, and
opportunities are sought for reading, shooting, and intercourse
with the natives, the voyage is delightful in the cool
season. Henry Martyn rejoiced in six weeks of this
solitary life&mdash;alone yet not alone, and ever about his
Father&rsquo;s business. His studies were divided between
Hindustani and Sanskrit; he was much occupied in prayer
and in the reading of the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures.
Morning and evening he spent himself among the
people on the banks, and at the ghauts and bazaars of
the mighty river, preaching Christ and spreading abroad
the New Testament. The dense population and the
spiritual darkness, as the panorama of native life moved
hourly before his eyes, on river and on land, stirred up the
busiest of Christians to be still busier, in spite of his fast-wasting
body;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> &lsquo;What a wretched life shall I lead if I do
not exert myself from morning till night, in a place where,
through whole territories, I seem to be the only light!&rsquo;
His gun supplied him with small game, &lsquo;enough to make a
change with the curry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At Cutwa, one of Carey&rsquo;s mission stations, he had
fellowship with Chamberlain, receiving that &lsquo;refreshment of
spirit which comes from the blessing of God on Christian
communion.&rsquo; &lsquo;Tell Marshman,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;with my
affectionate remembrance, that I have seriously begun the
Sanskrit Grammar.&rsquo; To Ward he sends a list of errata
which he found in a tract in the Persian character. He
had his Serampore moonshi with him. At Berhampore,
soon to be occupied by Mr. Parson as chaplain, and by the
London Missionary Society, he spent some time, for it was
the great military station of the old Nawab Nazim&rsquo;s
capital, Moorshidabad, which Clive described as wealthier
than London, and quite as populous. Henry Martyn at
once walked into the hospital, where the surgeon immediately
recognised him as an old schoolfellow and
townsman. But even with such help he could not induce
the men to rise and assemble for Divine service. &lsquo;I left
three books with them and went away amidst the sneers
and titters of the common soldiers. Certainly it is one of
the greatest crosses I am called to bear, to take pains to
make people hear me. It is such a struggle between a sense
of propriety and modesty on the one hand, and a sense of
duty on the other, that I find nothing equal to it.&rsquo; At
Rajmahal, like Carey six years before, he met some of the
hill tribes&mdash;&lsquo;wrote down from their mouth some of the
names of things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At Maldah he was in the heart of the little Christian
community which, under Charles Grant twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
before, had proved the salt of Anglo-Indian society, and
had made the first attempt with Carey&rsquo;s assistance to
open vernacular Christian schools. With Mr. Ellerton,
whose wife had witnessed the duel between Warren
Hastings and Philip Francis, and who as a widow indeed
lived to the Mutiny of 1857 as the friend of Bishop Daniel
Wilson, he went to Gomalty, and visited one of the schools.
&lsquo;The cheerful faces of the little boys, sitting cross-legged
on their mats round the floor, much delighted me. While
they displayed their power of reading, their fathers,
mothers, etc., crowded in numbers round the door and
windows.&rsquo; Here we see the now vast educational system
of Bengal in the birth. Not less striking is the contrast, due
to the progress of that system on its missionary side, when
we find Martyn, in 1806, recording his surprise at the
extraordinary fear and unwillingness of the people to take
tracts and books. One postmaster, when he found
what the booklet was about, returned it with the remark
that a person who had his legs in two boats went on his
way uncomfortably. Passing Colgong and Monghyr, he
&lsquo;reached Patna. Walked about the scene of my future
ministry with a spirit almost overwhelmed at the sight of
the immense multitudes.&rsquo; On November 26 he arrived at
Dinapore&mdash;&lsquo;the multitudes at the water-side prodigious.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nowhere, in British India as it was in 1807, could
Henry Martyn have found a better training field, at once
as chaplain to the troops and missionary to the Mohammedans,
than the Patna centre of the great province
of Bihar. For fourteen miles, Patna, the Mohammedan
city, Bankipore, the British civil station, and Dinapore, the
British military station, line the right bank of the Ganges,
which is there two miles broad. Patna itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>&mdash;&lsquo;the city,&rsquo;
as the word means&mdash;was the Buddhist capital to which
the Greek ambassador Megasthenes came from Seleukos
Nikator, 300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and the Chinese pilgrim, Hwen T&rsquo;sang,
637 years <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> But under the Mogul emperors and down
to the present day, Patna has been the focus of the most
fanatical sect of Islam. There Meer Kasim murdered
sixty Englishmen in 1763; and so little did a century&rsquo;s
civilisation affect the place, which Christian missionaries,
except Martyn, neglected till recently, that in 1857 it was
a centre of the Mutiny, and in 1872 it was the nucleus of
Wahabi rebellion. The second city in Bengal next to
Calcutta, and the fifth city in all India in inhabitants,
Patna with Bankipore and Dinapore commanded an
accessible native population of half a million. Such
was Henry Martyn&rsquo;s first &lsquo;parish&rsquo; in the East. For the
mass of these he opened schools and translated the Word of
God; with their learned men he &lsquo;disputed&rsquo; continually, in
the spirit of Paul seeking to commend to them the very
Christ.</p>

<p>Besides the Company&rsquo;s civil servants in Bankipore
whom he never ceased to influence, he was specially
charged with the spiritual care of two European regiments,
consisting at one time of 1,700 men and 80 officers in various
positions. Then and up till 1860, when what was known
as &lsquo;the White Mutiny&rsquo; led the Queen&rsquo;s Government to
disband the troops, the East India Company had a European
force of its own, specially recruited and paid more highly
than the royal regiments. The men were generally better
educated than the ordinary private of those days, were,
indeed, often runaway sons of good families and disreputable
adventurers from many countries. As a fighting
force they were splendid veterans; in all other respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their history and character as well as his own experience
of them on board ship, justified Martyn&rsquo;s language in
a letter to Mr. Brown. &lsquo;My disdainful and abandoned
countrymen among the military; they are impudent children
and stiff-hearted, and will receive, I fear, my ministrations,
as all the others have done, with scorn. Yet Jesus
wept over Jerusalem. Henceforward let me live with
Christ alone.&rsquo; How loving and faithful, if not always
tender, his ministry was among them and their native
women, and how it gained their respect till it formed a
little Church in the army, we shall see.</p>

<p>Having settled down in barrack apartments at 50 rupees
a month till he should get a house against the hot season,
and having called on the general commanding and others,
after the Anglo-Indian fashion, he reported to his longing
friends in Aldeen: &lsquo;I stand alone;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> not one voice is
heard saying, &ldquo;I wish you good luck in the name
of the Lord.&rdquo; I offered to come over to Bankipore to
officiate to them on the Sabbath. They are going to take
this into consideration. I have found out two schools in
Dinapore. I shall set on foot one or two schools without
delay, and by the time the scholars are able to read we can
get books ready for them.&rsquo; In this spirit and by a renewed
act of self-dedication he entered on the year 1807:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Seven years have passed away since I was first called
of God. Before the conclusion of another seven years, how
probable is it that these hands will have mouldered into
dust! But be it so: my soul through grace hath received
the assurance of eternal life, and I see the days of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
pilgrimage shortening without a wish to add to their
number. But oh, may I be stirred up to a faithful discharge
of my high and awful work; and laying aside, as much
as may be, all carnal cares and studies, may I give myself
to this &lsquo;one thing.&rsquo; The last has been a year to be
remembered by me, because the Lord has brought me
safely to India, and permitted me to begin, in one sense,
my missionary work. My trials in it have been very few;
everything has turned out better than I expected; loving-kindness
and tender mercies have attended me at every
step: therefore here will I sing His praise. I have been an
unprofitable servant, but the Lord hath not cut me off: I
have been wayward and perverse, yet He has brought me
further on the way to Zion; here, then, with sevenfold
gratitude and affection, would I stop and devote myself to
the blissful service of my adorable Lord. May He continue
His patience, His grace, His direction, His spiritual influences,
and I shall at last surely come off conqueror. May
He speedily open my mouth, to make known the mysteries
of the Gospel, and in great mercy grant that the heathen
may receive it and live!</p></div>

<p>The hostility of the officers and civilians to his message
sometimes became scorn, when they saw his efforts to
teach and preach to the natives. These were days when
the Patna massacre was still remembered. So few baptized
Christians knew the power of the Faith which they
practically dishonoured, that they had no desire to make it
known to others; many even actually resented the preaching
of Christ to the people, as both politically dangerous and
socially an insult to the ruling race. This feeling has long
since disappeared in India at least, though its expression is
not unknown in some of the colonies where the land is held
by the dark savages. Henry Martyn keenly felt such
opposition, and none the less that the natives of the Patna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
district&mdash;especially the Mohammedans&mdash;were in their turn
hostile to a government which had supplanted them so
recently. A few weeks after his arrival we find him writing
this in his <i>Journal</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, December 1.</i>&mdash;Early this morning I set off in my
palanquin for Patna. Something brought the remembrance
of my dear Lydia so powerfully to my mind that I could
not cease thinking of her for a moment. I know not when
my reflections seemed to turn so fondly towards her; at
the same time I scarcely dare to wish her to come to this
country. The whole country is manifestly disaffected. I
was struck at the anger and contempt with which multitudes
of the natives eyed me in my palanquin.</p>

<p><i>December 2.</i>&mdash;On my way back called on Mr. D., the
Judge, and Mr. F., at Bankipore. Mr. F.&rsquo;s conversation
with me about the natives was again a great trial to my
spirit; but in the multitude of my troubled thoughts I still
saw that there is a strong consolation in the hope set before
us. Let men do their worst, let me be torn to pieces, and
my dear L. torn from me; or let me labour for fifty years
amidst scorn, and never seeing one soul converted; still it
shall not be worse for my soul in eternity, nor worse for it
in time. Though the heathen rage and the English people
imagine a vain thing, the Lord Jesus, who controls all events,
is my friend, my master, my God, my all. On the Rock
of Ages when I feel my foot rest my head is lifted up
above all mine enemies round about, and I sing, yea, I will
sing praises unto the Lord. If I am not much mistaken,
sore trials are awaiting me from without. Yet the time
will come when they will be over. Oh, what sweet refuge
to the weary soul does the grave appear! There the
wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at
rest. Here every man I meet is an enemy; being an
enemy to God, he is an enemy to me also on that account;
but he is an enemy too to me because I am an Englishman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Oh, what a place must heaven be, where there are none but
friends! England appears almost a heaven upon earth,
because there one is not viewed as an unjust intruder;
but, oh, the heaven of my God! the general assembly of
the first-born, the spirits of the just made perfect, and
Jesus! Oh, let me for a little moment labour and suffer
reproach!</p>

<p><i>1807, January 2.</i>&mdash;They seem to hate to see me associating
at all with the natives, and one gave me a hint a
few days ago about taking my exercise on foot. But if
our Lord had always travelled about in His palanquin, the
poor woman who was healed by touching the hem of His
garment might have perished. Happily I am freed from
the shackles of custom; and the fear of man, though not
extirpated, does not prevail.</p>

<p><i>January 8.</i>&mdash;Pundit was telling me to-day that there
was a prophecy in their books that the English should
remain one hundred years in India, and that forty years
were now elapsed of that period; that there should be a
great change, and they should be driven out by a king&rsquo;s
son, who should then be born. Telling this to moonshi,
he said that about the same time the Mussulmans expected
some great events, such as the coming of Dujjel, and the
spread of Islam over the earth.</p>

<p><i>January 29.</i>&mdash;The expectation from prophecy is very
prevalent hereabouts that the time is coming when all the
Hindus will embrace the religion of the English; and the
pundit says that in many places they had already begun.
About Agra, and Delhi, and Narwa, in the Mahratta
dominions, there are many native Christian families.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s occupation of the Aldeen Pagoda had
resulted, after his departure, in the formation, by Brown,
Corrie, Parson, and Marmaduke Thompson, the Madras
chaplain, of what would now be called a clerical club, with
these three objects&mdash;to aid the British and Foreign Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Society, then recently established; to help forward the
translation of the Scriptures into the languages of the
East; and especially to meet the whole expense of the
Sanskrit and Greek Testaments, and to send on to Mr.
Brown, for circulation, a quarterly report of the prospects,
plans, and actual situation of each member so far as the
Church is concerned. Of this Evangelical Anglican
Brotherhood Martyn seems to have been the most active
member during his brief career. His translations were
made for it, in the first instance. &lsquo;The Synod&rsquo;, or &lsquo;the
Associated Clergy,&rsquo; as he called it at different times, when
as yet there was no Bishop of Calcutta, consciously linked
him to the fellowship of the Saints, to the Church and the
University from which he had come forth. We find him
noting seven years after &lsquo;the day I left Cambridge: my
thoughts frequently recurred with many tender recollections
to that beloved seat of my brethren, and again I wandered
in spirit amongst the trees on the banks of the Cam.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The letters from these four chaplains cheered him at
Dinapore when he was &lsquo;very much depressed in spirits,&rsquo; and
he hastens to write to each, giving this picture of his life:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From a solitary walk on the banks of the river I had
just returned to my dreary rooms, and with the reflection
that just at this time of the day I could be thankful for a
companion, was taking up the flute to remind myself
of your social meetings in worship, when your two
packages of letters, which had arrived in my absence, were
brought to me. For the contents of them, all I can say is,
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless
His holy name! The arrival of another dear brother, and
the joy you so largely partake of in fellowship with God
and with one another, act as a cordial to my soul. They
show me what I want to learn, that the Lord God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Omnipotent reigneth, and that they that keep the faith of
Jesus are those only whom God visits with His strong
consolations. I want to keep in view that our God is the
God of the whole earth, and that the heathen are given to
His exalted Son, the uttermost parts of the earth for a
possession.</p></div>

<p>Continually his love of music breaks forth alike for
the worship of God and the association of friendship and
affection. His correspondence with Brown was regular,
but as that of a son with a father. His letters to Corrie,
his old Cambridge junior, are frank and free. His joy was
great when Corrie was stationed at the rock-fortress of
Chunar, not very far from Dinapore, so that they occasionally
met and officiated for each other. But up to this time
his chief, his almost fearful human, delight was to think of
Lydia by night and by day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1806, December 10.</i>&mdash;A dream last night was so like
reality, and the impression after it was so deep upon my
spirits, that I must record the date of it. It was about
Lydia. I dreamt that she had arrived, but that after some
conversation I said to her, &lsquo;I know this is a dream; it is too
soon after my letter for you to have come.&rsquo; Alas! it is
only a dream; and with this I awoke, and sighed to think
that it was indeed only a dream. Perhaps all my hope
about her is but a dream! Yet be it so; whatever God
shall appoint must be good for us both, and with that I will
endeavour to be tranquil and happy, pursuing my way
through the wilderness with equal steadiness, whether with
or without a companion.</p>

<p><i>December 14.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Service performed by an
after order, at ten o&rsquo;clock. The general was present, about
twenty officers, and some of their ladies. I preached on the
parable of the tares of the field. Much of the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
day I was in great distraction, owing to the incessant recurrence
of thoughts about Lydia. My impatience and
fear respecting her sometimes rose to such a height that I
felt almost as at Falmouth, when I was leaving Europe, as
I thought to see her no more. But in the evening it pleased
the Lord to show me something of the awful nearness of
the world of spirits, and the unmeasurable importance of
my having my thoughts and cares devoted to my missionary
work. Thus I obtained peace. I prayed in sincerity and
fervour, that if there were any obstacle in the sight of God,
the Lord might never suffer us to meet.</p>

<p><i>December 21.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;In the evening, after a solemn
season of prayer, I received letters from Europe, one from
Cousin T., Emma, Lydia, and others. The torrent of
vivid affection which passed through my heart at receiving
such assurances of regard continued almost without intermission
for four hours. Yet, in reflection afterwards, the
few words my dearest Lydia wrote turned my joy into
tender sympathy with her. Who knows what her heart
has suffered! After all, our God is our best portion; and
it is true that if we are never permitted to meet, we shall
enjoy blissful intercourse for ever in glory.</p>

<p><i>December 22.</i>&mdash;Thinking far too much of dear Lydia all
day.</p>

<p><i>December 23.</i>&mdash;Set apart the chief part of this day for
prayer, with fasting; but I do not know that my soul got
much good. Oh, what need have I to be stirred up by the
Spirit of God, to exert myself in prayer! Had no freedom
or power in prayer, though some appearance of tenderness.
Lydia is a snare to me; I think of her so incessantly, and
with such foolish and extravagant fondness, that my heart
is drawn away from God. Thought at night, Can that be
true love which is other than God would have it? No;
that which is lawful is most genuine when regulated by
the holy law of God.</p>

<p><i>December 25.</i>&mdash;Preached on 1 Tim. i. 15 to a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
congregation. Those who remained at the Sacrament
were chiefly ladies, and none of them young men. My
heart still entangled with this idolatrous affection, and
consequently unhappy. Sometimes I gained deliverance
from it for a short time, and was happy in the love of God.
How awful the thought, that while perishing millions
demand my every thought and care, my mind should be
distracted about such an extreme trifle as that of my own
comfort! Oh, let me at last have done with it, and the
merciful God save me from departing from Him, and
committing that horrible crime of forsaking the fountain
of living waters, and hewing out to myself broken
cisterns.</p></div>

<p>As the delightful cold season of the Bihar uplands
passed all too quickly, and the dry hot winds of Upper
India began to scorch its plains, the solitary man began
to think it &lsquo;impossible I could ever subsist long in such a
climate.&rsquo; From April 1807 his hereditary disease made
rapid advances, while he reproached himself for lassitude
and comparative idleness, and put additional constraint
on himself to work and to pray unceasingly. From this
time his <i>Journal</i> has frequent records of sickness, of loss
of appetite, and of &lsquo;pain&rsquo; in his ministrations, ending in
loss of voice altogether for a time. Corrie and Brown and
his other correspondents remonstrated, but they were at a
distance. He needed a watchful and authoritative nurse
such as only a wife could be, and he found only lack of
sympathy or active opposition. He lived, as we can now see,
as no white man in the tropics in any rank of life should live,
from sheer simplicity, unselfishness, and consuming zeal.
When the hot winds drove him out of the barracks, the first
rainy season flooded his house. At all times and amid the
insanitary horrors of an Indian cemetery he had to bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the dead of a large cantonment in a sickly season. His
daily visits to the hospital were prolonged, for there he
came soul to soul with the sinner, the penitent, and the
rejoicing. And all the time he is writing to Corrie and
each of his friends, &lsquo;I feel anxious for your health.&rsquo; To
marry officers and baptize children he had to make long
journeys by palanquin, and expose his wasting body alike
to heat and rain. But amid it all his courage never fails,
for it is rooted in God; his heart is joyful, for he has the
peace that passeth all understanding.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1807, May 18.</i>&mdash;Through great mercy my health and
strength are supported as by a daily miracle. But oh, the
heat! By every device of darkness and tatties I cannot
keep the thermometer below 92°, and at night in bed I
seem in danger of suffocation. Let me know somewhat
more particularly what the heat is, and how you contrive
to bear it. The worst bad effect I experience is the utter
loss of appetite. I dread the eating time.</p>

<p><i>July 7.</i>&mdash;Heat still so great as to oblige me to abandon
my quarters.</p>

<p><i>July 8.</i>&mdash;Went to Bankipore to baptize a child. One
of the ladies played some hymn-tunes on my account. If
I were provided with proper books much good might
be done by these visits, for I meet with general acceptance
and deference. In the evening buried a man who had
died in the hospital after a short illness. My conscience
felt again a conviction of guilt at considering how
many precious hours I waste on trifles, and how cold and
lukewarm my spirit is when addressing souls.</p>

<p><i>August 23.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached on Job xix. 25-27:
&lsquo;I know that my redeemer liveth.&rsquo; There seemed little
or no attention; only one officer there besides Major Young.
At Hindustani prayers, the women few, but attentive;
again blest with much freedom; at the hospital was seized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with such pain from over-exertion of my voice, that I was
obliged to leave off and go away.</p></div>

<p>To Brown he writes: &lsquo;The rains try my constitution.
I am apt to be troubled with shortness of breath, as at
the time I left you. Another rainy reason I must climb
some hill and live there; but the Lord is our rock. While
there is work which <i>we</i> must do, we shall live.&rsquo; Again in
the early Sunday morning of August he dreamed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That as I was attacked so violently in July, but recovered,
at the same time next year I should be attacked
again, and carried off by death. This, however, would only
be awaking in a better world. If I may but awake up
satisfied with Thy likeness, why shall I be afraid? I think
I have but one wish to live, which is, that I may do the
Lord&rsquo;s work, particularly in the Persian and Hindustani
translations; for this I could almost feel emboldened to
supplicate, like Hezekiah, for prolongation of life, even after
receiving this, which may be a warning.</p></div>

<p>After six months&rsquo; experience of his Dinapore-cum-Patna
parish, Martyn sent in &lsquo;to the Associated Clergy&rsquo; the
first quarterly report of his own spiritual life, and of his
work for others.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>April 6.</i>&mdash;I begin my first communication to my dear
and honoured brethren, with thankfully accepting their
proposal of becoming a member of their society, and I
bless the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for this
new instance of His mercy to His unworthy creature. May
His grace and favour be vouchsafed to us, and His Holy
Spirit direct all our proceedings, and sanctify our communications
to the purposes for which we are united.</p>

<p>On a review of the state of my mind since my arrival
at Dinapore, I observe that the graces of joy and love
have been at a low ebb. Faith has been chiefly called into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
exercise, and without a simple dependence on the Divine
promises I should still every day sink into fatal despondency.
Self-love and unbelief have been suggesting many
foolish fears respecting the difficulties of my future work
among the heathen. The thought of interrupting a crowd
of busy people like those at Patna, whose every day is a
market-day, with a message about eternity, without command
of language sufficient to explain and defend myself,
and so of becoming the scorn of the rabble without doing
them good, was offensive to my pride. The manifest disaffection
of the people, and the contempt with which they
eyed me, confirmed my dread. Added to this the unjust
proceedings of many of the principal magistrates hereabout
led me to expect future commotions in the country, and
that consequently poverty and murder would terminate my
career.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;As
thy days are so shall thy strength be,&rsquo; were passages
continually brought to my remembrance, and with
these at last my mind grew quiet. Our countrymen, when
speaking of the natives, said, as they usually do, that they
cannot be converted, and if they could they would be worse
than they are. Though I have observed before now that
the English are not in the way of knowing much about the
natives, yet the number of difficulties they mentioned
proved another source of discouragement to me. It is surprising
how positively they are apt to speak on this subject,
from their never acknowledging God in anything: &lsquo;Thy
judgments are far above out of his sight.&rsquo; If we labour to the
end of our days without seeing one convert, it shall not be
worse for us in time, and our reward is the same in eternity.
The cause in which we are engaged is the cause of mercy
and truth, and therefore, in spite of seeming impossibilities,
it must eventually prevail.</p>

<p>I have been also occasionally troubled with infidel
thoughts, which originated perhaps from the cavillings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the Mohammedans about the person of Christ; but these
have been never suffered to be more than momentary. At
such times the awful holiness of the Word of God, and the
deep seriousness pervading it, were more refreshing to my
heart than the most encouraging promises in it. How despicable
must the Koran appear with its mock majesty and
paltry precepts to those who can read the Word of God!
It must presently sink into contempt when the Scriptures
are known.</p>

<p>Sometimes when those fiery darts penetrated more
deeply, I found safety only in cleaving to God, as a child
clasps to his mother&rsquo;s neck. These things teach me the
melancholy truth that the grace of a covenant God can
alone keep me from apostasy and ruin.</p>

<p>The European society here consists of the military at
the cantonment and the civil servants at Bankipore. The
latter neither come into church nor have accepted the
offer of my coming to officiate to them. There is, however,
no contempt shown, but rather respect. Of the
military servants very few officers attend, and of late
scarcely any of the married families, but the number of
privates, and the families of the merchants, always make
up a respectable congregation. They have as yet heard
very little of the doctrines of the Gospel. I have in general
endeavoured to follow the directions contained in Mr.
Milner&rsquo;s letter on this subject, as given in Mr. Brown&rsquo;s
paper, No. 4.</p>

<p>At the hospital I have read Doddridge&rsquo;s <i>Rise and
Progress</i>, and <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>. As the people objected
to extempore preaching at church, I have in compliance
with their desires continued to use a book. But
on this subject I should be glad of some advice from my
brethren.</p>

<p>I think it needless to communicate the plans or heads
of any of my sermons, as they have been chiefly on the
Parables. It is of more importance to observe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Word has not gone forth in vain, blessed be God! as it has
hitherto seemed to do in most places where I have been
called to minister; and this I feel to be an animating testimony
of His presence and blessing. I think the commanding
officer of the native regiment here and his lady are
seeking their salvation in earnest; they now refuse all
invitations on the Lord&rsquo;s day, and pass most of that day
at least in reading the Word, and at all times discover an
inclination to religious conversation. Among the privates,
one I have little doubt is truly converted to God, and is a
great refreshment to me. He parted at once with his
native woman, and allows her a separate maintenance.
His conversion has excited much notice and conversation
about religion among the rest, and three join him in coming
twice a week to my quarters for exposition, singing and
prayer.</p>

<p>I visit the English very little, and yet have had sufficient
experience of the difficulty of knowing how a minister
should converse with his people. I have myself fallen into
the worst extreme, and, from fear of making them connect
religion with gloom, have been led into such shameful levity
and conformity to them as ought to fill me with grief and
deep self-abasement.</p>

<p>How repeatedly has guilt been brought upon my conscience
in this way! Oh, how will the lost souls with
whom I have trifled the hours away look at me in the day
of judgment! I hope I am more and more convinced of
the wickedness and folly of assuming any other character
than that of a minister. I ought to consider that my
proper business with the flock over which the Holy Ghost
hath made me overseer is the business of another world,
and if they will not consider it in the same light, I do not
think that I am bound to visit them.</p>

<p>About the middle of last month, the Church service
being ready in Hindustani, I submitted to the commanding
officer of the European regiment a proposal to perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Divine service regularly for the native women of his
regiment, to which he cordially assented. The whole
number of women, about 200, attended with great readiness,
and have continued to do so. Instead of a sermon,
the Psalms, and the appointed lessons, I read in two
portions the Gospel of St. Matthew regularly forward,
and occasionally make some small attempts at expounding.
The conversion of any of such despised people is
never likely perhaps to be of any extensive use in regard
to the natives at large; but they are a people committed
to me by God, and as dear to Him as others; and next in
order after the English, they come within the expanding
circle of action.</p>

<p>After much trouble and delay, three schools have been
established for the native children on Mr. Creighton&rsquo;s
plan&mdash;one at Dinapore, one at Bankipore, and one at
Patna, at the last of which the Persian character is taught
as well as the Nagri. The number of children already is
about sixty. The other schoolmasters, not liking the
introduction of these free schools, spread the report that
my intention was to make them Christians, and send them
to Europe; in consequence of which the zemindars retracted
their promises of land, and the parents refused to
send their children; but my schoolmasters very sensibly
went to the people, and told them, &lsquo;We are men well known
among you, and when we are made Christians then do you
begin to fear.&rsquo; So their apprehensions have subsided; but
when the book of Parables, which is just finished, is put
into their hands, I expect a revival of their fears. My
hope is that I shall be able to ingratiate myself a little
with the people before that time; but chiefly that a
gracious God will not suffer Satan to keep his ground any
longer, now that the appointed means are used to dislodge
him. But, though these plans should fail, I hope to be
strengthened to fight against him all my days. For, from
what I feel within and see without, I know enough of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to vow, with my brethren, eternal enmity against him and
his cause.</p>

<p>Respecting the state of the natives hereabouts, I believe
that the Hindus are lax, for the rich men being few or
none, there are few Brahmins and few <i>tumashas</i> (<i>fêtes</i>),
and without these idolatry droops. The Mohammedans are
numerous and ignorant, but from the best of them I cannot
learn that more than three arguments can be offered
for their religion, which are&mdash;the miracles wrought by
Mohammed, those still wrought by his followers, and his
challenge in the second chapter of the Koran, about producing
a chapter like it, all of which are immediately
answered.</p>

<p>If my brethren have any others brought forward to
them they will, I hope, mention them; and if they have
observed any remark or statement apparently affect a
native&rsquo;s mind, they will notice it.</p>

<p>Above all things, <i>seriousness</i> in argument with them
seems most desirable, for without it they laugh away the
clearest proofs. Zeal for making proselytes they are used
to, and generally attribute to a false motive; but a tender
concern manifested for their souls is certainly new to them,
and seemingly produces corresponding seriousness in their
minds.</p>

<p>From an officer who had been in the Mahratta service,
I learned some time ago that there were large bodies of
Christians at Narwa, in the Mahratta dominions, Sardhana,
Delhi, Agra, Bettia, Boglipore. To obtain more information
respecting them, I sent a circular letter to the missionaries
residing at the three latter places, and have
received two letters in reply. The padre at Boglipore is a
young man just arrived, and his letter contains no information.
From the letter of the padre at Agra I subjoin
some extracts, premising that my questions were: 1. By
whom were you sent? 2. How long has a mission been
established in the place of your residence? 3. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
itinerate, and to what distance? 4. Have you any portion
of the MSS. translated, or do you distribute tracts? 5. Do
you allow any remains of caste to the baptized? 6. Have
you schools? are the masters heathen or Christians? 7. Is
there any native preacher or catechist? 8. Number of
converts.</p>

<p>In concluding my report, I take the liberty of proposing
two questions on which I should be thankful for communications
in your next quarterly report.</p>

<p>1. On the manner in which a minister should observe
the Sabbath; whether he should make it a point of duty
to leave no part of his discourses to prepare on that day?
Whether our particular situation in this country, requiring
redoubled exertion in those of us at least who are called
to the heathen, will justify the introduction of a secular
work into the Sabbath, such as translating the Scriptures,
etc.?</p>

<p>2. In the commencement of our labours among the
heathen, to which model should our preaching be conformed,&mdash;to
that of John the Baptist and our Saviour, or
that of the Apostles? The first mode seems more natural,
and if necessary for the Jews, comparatively so enlightened,
how much more for the heathen, who have scarcely any
notions of morality! On the other hand, the preaching of
the cross has in all ages won the most ignorant savages;
and the Apostles preached it at once to heathens as
ignorant perhaps as these.</p></div>

<p>Like Marshman and the Serampore missionaries,
Henry Martyn kept up a Latin correspondence with the
missionaries sent from Rome by the Propaganda to the
stations founded by Xavier, and those afterwards established
by that saint&rsquo;s nephew in the days of the tolerant Akbar.
At the beginning of this century, Anglican, Baptist, and
Romanist missionaries all over the East co-operated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
each other in translation work and social intercourse.
More than once Martyn protected the priest at Patna from
the persecution of the military authorities. He planned a
visit to their station at Bettia, to the far north, at the
foot of the Himalayas. In hospital his ministrations
were always offered to the Irish soldiers in the absence
of their own priest, and always without any controversial
reference. In his <i>Journal</i> he is often indignant at the
Popish perversion of the doctrines of grace, and in preaching
he occasionally set forth the truth, but in pastoral and
social intercourse he never failed to show the charity of the
Christian scholar and the gentleman.</p>

<p>Major Young, with his wife, was the first of the officers
to welcome Martyn&rsquo;s preaching. Soon the men in hospital
learned to appreciate his daily visits, and to attend to his
earnest reading and talk. A few began to meet with him
at his own house regularly, for prayer and the exposition
of Holy Scripture. In January, he writes of one Sunday:
&lsquo;Great attention. I think the Word is not going forth in
vain. In the afternoon read at the hospital. The steward
I found had been long stationed at Tanjore and knew
Schwartz; that Schwartz baptized the natives not by immersion,
but by sprinkling, and with godfathers, and read the
services both in English and Tamil. Felt much delighted
at hearing anything about him. The man told me that
the men at the hospital were very attentive and thankful
that I came amongst them. Passed the evening with great
joy and peace in singing hymns.&rsquo; In the heat of May he
writes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> &lsquo;Found fifty sick at the hospital, who heard <i>The
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> with great delight. Some men came
to-night, but my prayer with them was exceedingly poor
and lifeless.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In these days, thanks to Lord Lawrence and Sir Henry
Norman, there is a prayer-hall in every cantonment, ever
open for the soldier who seeks quiet communion with God.
Then&mdash;&lsquo;Six soldiers came to me to-night. To escape as
much as possible the taunts of their wicked companions,
they go out of their barracks in opposite directions to come
to me. At night a young Scotsman of the European
regiment came to me for a hymn-book. He expressed
with tears his past wickedness and determination to lead
a religious life.&rsquo; On the other side we have such passages
as these: &lsquo;What sort of men are these committed to my
care? I had given them one more warning about their
whoredom and drunkenness, and it&rsquo;s the truth grappling
with their consciences that makes them furious.&rsquo; Of the
Company&rsquo;s European regiment he writes to Corrie: &lsquo;A
more wicked set of men were, I suppose, never seen.
The general, the colonel of the 67th, and their own
colonel all acknowledge it. At the hospital when I visit
their part, some go to a corner and invoke blasphemies upon
me because, as they now believe, the man I speak to dies
to a certainty.&rsquo; A young lieutenant of fine abilities he
recommended strenuously to go into the ministry.</p>

<p>Although, fifteen years before, Sir John Shore had
given orders as to the building of churches at military
stations, and Lord Wellesley had set an example of interest
in the moral and spiritual welfare of the Company&rsquo;s servants,
nothing had been done outside of the three Presidency
cities. All that Henry Martyn found provided for him,
as chaplain, on his first Sunday at Dinapore, was a long
drum, on which he placed the Prayer-book. He was
requested not to preach, because the men could not stand
so long. He found the men playing at fives on Sunday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
All that he soon changed, by an appeal to the general to
put a stop to the games on Sunday, and by holding service
at first in a barrack, and then in his own house. Before
leaving Calcutta he had observed, in a conversation with
the Governor-General, on the disgrace of there being no
places of worship at the principal subordinate stations; upon
which directions were given to prepare plans of building.
He wrote to the equally troubled Corrie at Chunar. A
year later nothing had been done, and he draws this picture
to Corrie: &lsquo;From the scandalous disorder in which the
Company have left the ecclesiastical part of their affairs, so
that we have no place fit, our assemblies are little like
worshipping assemblies. No kneeling because no room;
no singing, no responses.&rsquo; At last Sir George Barlow sent
an order for an estimate for building a church, but Martyn
had left for Cawnpore, only to see a worse state of things
there. But the faithfulness of the &lsquo;black&rsquo; chaplains was
telling. He writes, on March 14, 1808:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The 67th are now all here. The number of their sick
makes the hospital congregation very considerable, so that
if I had no natives, translations, etc., to think of, there is
call enough for my labours and prayers among all these
Europeans. The general at my request has determined to
make the whole body of troops attend in three divisions;
and yesterday morning the Company&rsquo;s European, and two
companies of the King&rsquo;s, came to church in great pomp,
with a fine band of music playing. The King&rsquo;s officers,
according to their custom, have declared their intention
not to call upon the Company&rsquo;s; therefore I mean to
call upon them. I believe I told you that 900 of the
67th are Roman Catholics. It seemed an uncommonly
splendid Mohurrum here also. Mr. H., an assistant judge
lately appointed to Patna, joined the procession in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Hindustani dress, and went about beating his breast, etc.
This is a place remarkable for such folly. The old judge,
you know, has built a mosque here, and the other judge
issued an order that no marriage nor any feasting should
be held during the season of Mohammedan grief. A
remarkably sensible young man called on me yesterday
with the Colonel; they both seem well disposed to religion.
I receive many gratifying testimonies to the change
apparently taking place among the English in religious
matters in India; testimonies, I mean, from the mouths
of the people, for I confess I do not observe much
myself.</p></div>

<p>Having translated the Church Service into Hindustani,
Henry Martyn was ready publicly to minister to the
native women belonging to the soldiers of the Company&rsquo;s
European regiment. From such unions, rarely lawful,
sprang the now great and important Eurasian community,
many of whom have done good service to the Church and
the Empire. &lsquo;The Colonel approved, but told me that it
was my business to find them an order, and not his.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1807, March 23.</i>&mdash;So I issued my command to the
Sergeant-Major to give public notice in the barracks that
there would be Divine service in the native language on the
morrow. The morrow came, and the Lord sent 200 women,
to whom I read the whole of the morning service. Instead
of the lessons I began Matthew, and ventured to expound
a little, and but a little. Yesterday we had a service
again, but I think there were not more than 100. To
these I opened my mouth rather more boldly, and though
there was the appearance of lamentable apathy in the
countenances of most of them, there were two or three
who understood and trembled at the sermon of John the
Baptist. This proceeding of mine is, I believe, generally
approved among the English, but the women come, I fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
rather because it is the wish of their masters. The day
after attending service they went in flocks to the Mohurrum,
and even of those who are baptized, many, I am told,
are so addicted to their old heathenism, that they obtain
money from their husbands to give to the Brahmins. Our
time of Divine service in English is seven in the morning,
and in Hindustani two in the afternoon. May the Lord
smile on this first attempt at ministration in the native
language!</p>

<p><i>1807, March 23.</i>&mdash;A few days ago I went to Bankipore
to fulfil my promise of visiting the families there; and
amongst the rest called on a poor creature whose black
wife has made him apostatise to Mohammedanism and
build a mosque. Major Young went with me, and the old
man&rsquo;s son-in-law was there. He would not address a
single word to me, nor a salutation at parting, because I
found an occasion to remind him that the Son of God had
suffered in the stead of sinners. The same day I went on
to Patna to see how matters stood with respect to the
school. Its situation is highly favourable, near an old gate
now in the midst of the city, and where three ways meet;
neither master nor children were there. The people
immediately gathered round me in great numbers, and the
crowd thickened so fast, that it was with difficulty I could
regain my palanquin. I told them that what they understood
by making people Christians was not my intention;
I wished the children to be taught to fear God and become
good men, and that if, after this declaration, they were still
afraid, I could do no more; the fault was not mine, but
theirs. My schools have been heard of among the English
sooner than I wished or expected. The General observed
to me one morning that that school of mine made a very
good appearance from the road; &lsquo;but,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you will
make no proselytes.&rsquo; If that be all the opposition he
makes, I shall not much mind.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>A week later he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>March 30.</i>&mdash;Sick in body, but rather serious and humble
in spirit, and so happy; corrected the Parables for a fair
copy. Reading the Koran and Hindustani Ramayuna,
and translating Revelation; a German sergeant came with
his native woman to have her baptized; I talked with her
a good while, in order to instruct her, and found her extraordinarily
quick in comprehension.</p>

<p><i>April 1.</i>&mdash;The native woman came again, and I passed
a great deal of time in instructing her in the nature of the
Gospel; but, alas! till the Lord touch her heart, what can
a man do? At night the soldiers came, and we had again
a very happy time; how graciously the Lord fulfils His
promise of being where two or three are gathered together!
The pious soldier grows in faith and love, and spoke of
another who wants to join us. They said that the native
women accounted it a great honour to be permitted to
come to a church and hear the Word of God, and wondered
why I should take such trouble for them.</p></div>

<p>&lsquo;How shall it ever be possible to convince a Hindu or
Brahmin of anything?&rsquo; wrote Henry Martyn to Corrie
after two years&rsquo; experience in Bengal.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1808, January 4.</i>&mdash;Truly, if ever I see a Hindu a real
believer in Jesus, I shall see something more nearly
approaching the resurrection of a dead body than anything
I have yet seen. However, I well remember Mr.
Ward&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;The common people are angels compared
with the Brahmins.&rsquo; Perhaps the strong man armed, that
keeps the goods in peace, shall be dispossessed from these,
when the mighty Word of God comes to be ministered
by us.</p></div>

<p>&lsquo;We shall live to see better days.&rsquo; For these he prepared
his translations of the Word of God. He wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
itinerate among the people, but his military duties kept
him to the station. When Mr. Brown made another
attempt to get him fixed in the Mission-Church he replied,
&lsquo;The evangelisation of India is a more important object
than preaching to the European inhabitants of Calcutta.&rsquo;
To Corrie he wrote: &lsquo;Those sequestered valleys seen from
Chunar present an inviting field for missionary labours.
A Sikh, making a pilgrimage to Benares, came to me; he
was very ignorant, and I do not know whether he understood
what I endeavoured to show him about the folly of
pilgrimages, the nature of true holiness, and the plan of
the Gospel.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1808, February 12.</i>&mdash;Sabat describes so well the character
of a missionary that I am ashamed of my great house,
and mean to sell it the first opportunity, and take the
smallest quarters I can find. Would that the day were
come when I might throw off the coat and substitute the
jamer; I long for it more and more; and am often very
uneasy at being in the neighbourhood of so great a Nineveh
without being able to do anything immediately for the
salvation of so many perishing souls. What do you think
of my standing under a shed somewhere in Patna as the
missionaries did in the Lal Bazar? Will the Government
interfere? What are your sensations on the late news?
I fear the judgments of God on our proud nation, and that,
as we have done nothing for the Gospel in India, this vineyard
will be let out to others who shall bring the fruits of
it in their season. I think the French would not treat
Juggernaut with quite so much ceremony as we do.</p></div>

<p>Above all men in India, at that time and during the
next half-century, however, Henry Martyn was a missionary
to the Mohammedans. For them he learned and he
translated Hindustani, Persian, and Arabic. With their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
moulvies he conducted controversies; and for years he
associated with himself that extraordinary Arab, Sabat,
who made life a burden to him.</p>

<p>Sabat and Abdallah, two Arabs of notable pedigree,
becoming friends, resolved to travel together. After a
visit to Mecca they went to Cabul, where Abdallah entered
the service of Zeman Shah, the famous Ameer. There an
Armenian lent him the Arabic Bible, he became a Christian,
and he fled for his life to Bokhara. Sabat had preceded him
there, and at once recognised him on the street. &lsquo;I had
no pity,&rsquo; said Sabat afterwards. &lsquo;I delivered him up to
Morad Shah, the king.&rsquo; He was offered his life if he would
abjure Christ. He refused. Then one of his hands was
cut off, and again he was pressed to recant. &lsquo;He made no
answer, but looked up steadfastly towards heaven, like
Stephen, the first martyr, his eyes streaming with tears.
He looked at me, but it was with the countenance of forgiveness.
His other hand was then cut off. But he never
changed, and when he bowed his head to receive the blow
of death all Bokhara seemed to say, &ldquo;What new thing is
this?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Remorse drove Sabat to long wanderings, in which he
came to Madras, where the Government gave him the
office of mufti, or expounder of the law of Islam in the
civil courts. At Vizagapatam he fell in with a copy of the
Arabic New Testament as revised by Solomon Negri, and
sent out to India by the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge in the middle of last century. He compared
it with the Koran, the truth fell on him &lsquo;like a flood of
light,&rsquo; and he sought baptism in Madras at the hands of
the Rev. Dr. Kerr. He was named Nathaniel. He was
then twenty-seven years of age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>When the news reached his family in Arabia his
brother set out to destroy him, and, disguised as an
Asiatic, wounded him with a dagger as he sat in his house
at Vizagapatam. He sent him home with letters and gifts
to his mother, and then gave himself up to propagate the
truth he had once, in his friend Abdallah&rsquo;s person, persecuted
to the death. He became one of the translating
staff of the Serampore brotherhood, and did good service
on the Arabic and Persian Scriptures. Mr. John Marshman,
who knew him well, used to describe him as a man of lofty
station, of haughty carriage, and with a flowing black
beard. Delighted with the simple life and devotion of
the missionaries, he dismissed his two Arab servants, and
won the affection of all. When Serampore arranged to
leave to Henry Martyn the Persian translation of the
New Testament, Sabat left them with tears in his eyes
for Dinapore. In almost nothing does the saintliness of
Martyn appear so complete as in the references in his
<i>Journal</i> to the pride, the vanity, the malice, the rage of this
&lsquo;artless child of the desert,&rsquo; when it became apparent that
his knowledge of Persian and Arabic had been over-estimated.
The passages are pathetic, and are equalled only
by those which, in the closing days of his life, describe the
dying missionary&rsquo;s treatment by his Tartar escort. But to
the last, Sabat, according to Colonel MacInnes of Penang,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
&lsquo;never spoke of Mr. Martyn without the most profound
respect, and shed tears of grief whenever he recalled how
severely he had tried the patience of this faithful servant
of God. He mentioned several anecdotes to show with
what extraordinary sweetness Martyn had borne his
numerous provocations. &ldquo;He was less a man,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;than an angel from heaven.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The rest of Sabat&rsquo;s story may at once be told. Moved
by rage at the exposure, by the Calcutta moonshis, of the
incorrectness of his Arabic, and at the suspicions that his
translations were copies from some old version, Sabat
apostatised by publishing a virulent attack on Christianity.
&lsquo;As when Judas acted the traitor, Ananias the liar, and
Simon Magus the refined hypocrite, so it was when Sabat
daringly departed from the nominal profession of the truth.
The righteous sorrowed, the unrighteous triumphed; yet
wisdom was justified of her children,&rsquo; wrote Mr. Sargent.
He left Calcutta as a trader for Penang, where he wrote to
the local newspaper declaring that he professed Christianity
anew, and he entered the service of the fugitive Sultan of
Acheen, on the north of Sumatra. Thence, when he was
imprisoned by the insurgents, he wrote letters with his own
blood to the Penang authorities, declaring that he was in
some sense a martyr for Christ. All the private efforts of
Colonel MacInnes to obtain his freedom were in vain; he
was tied up in a sack and thrown into the sea. In the
light of these events we must now read Henry Martyn&rsquo;s
<i>Journal</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1807, August 24.</i>&mdash;To live without sin is what I cannot
expect in this world, but to desire to live without it may
be the experience of every hour. Thinking to-night of
the qualifications of Sabat, I felt the conviction, both in
reflection and prayer, of the power of God to make him
another St. Paul.</p>

<p><i>November 10.</i>&mdash;The very first day we began to spar.
He would come into none of my plans, nor did I approve
of his; but I gave way, and by yielding prevailed, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
now does everything I tell him.... Sabat lives and eats
with me, and goes to his bungalow at night, so that I hope
he has no care on his mind. On Sunday morning he went
to church with me. While I was in the vestry a bearer
took away his chair from him, saying it was another
gentleman&rsquo;s. The Arab took fire and left the church, and
when I sent the clerk after him he would not return. He
anticipated my expostulations after church, and began to
lament that he had <i>two</i> dispositions, one old, the other
new.</p>

<p><i>1808, January 11.</i>&mdash;Sabat sometimes awakes some of the
evil parts of my nature. Finding I have no book of Logic,
he wishes to translate one of his compositions, to instruct me
in that science. He is much given to contradict, and set
people right, and that he does with an air so dogmatical,
that I have not seen the like of it since I left Cambridge.
He looks on the missionaries at Serampore as so many
degrees below him in intellect, that he says he could write
so deeply on a text, that not one of them would be able to
follow him. So I have challenged him in their name, and
to-day he has brought me the first half of his essay or
sermon on a text: with some ingenuity, it has the most
idle display of school-boy pedantic logic you ever saw. I
shall translate it from the Persian, in order to assist him to
rectify his errors. He is certainly learned in the learning
of the Arabs, and how he has acquired so much in a life so
active is strange, but I wish it could be made to sit a little
easier on him. I look forward to St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, in
hopes some good will come to him from them. It is a
very happy circumstance that he did not go to preach at
his first conversion; he would have entangled himself in
metaphysical subjects out of his depth, and probably made
shipwreck of his own faith. I have, I think, led him to
see that it is dangerous and foolish to attempt to prove the
doctrine of the Trinity by reason, as he said at first he was
perfectly able to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 30.</i>&mdash;Sabat to-day finishes St. Matthew, and
will write to you on the occasion. Your letter to him was
very kind and suitable, but I think you must not mention
his logic to him, except with contempt; for he takes what
you say on that head as homage due to his acquirements,
and praise to him is brandy to a man in a high fever. He
loves as a Christian brother; but as a logician he holds us
all in supreme contempt. He assumes all the province of
reasoning as his own by right, and decides every question
magisterially. He allows Europeans to know a little
about Arithmetic and Navigation, but nothing more.
Dear man! I smile to observe his pedantry. Never have
I seen such an instance of dogmatical pride since I heard
Dr. Parr preach his Greek Sermon at St. Mary&rsquo;s, about
the τὸ ὄν.</p>

<p><i>March 7.</i>&mdash;Mirza is gone to the Mohurrum to-day: he
discovers no signs of approach to the truth. Sabat creates
himself enemies in every quarter by his jealous and
passionate spirit, particularly among the servants. At his
request I have sent away my tailor and bearers, and he
is endeavouring to get my other servants turned away;
because without any proof he suspects them of having
persuaded the bearers not to come into his service. He
can now get no bearers nor tailor to serve him. One day
this week he came to me, and said that he meant to write
to Mr. Brown to remove him from this place, for everything
went wrong&mdash;the people were all wicked, etc. The
immediate cause of this vexation was that some boxes,
which he had been making at the expense of 150 rupees,
all cracked at the coming on of the hot weather. I concealed
my displeasure at his childish fickleness of temper,
and discovered no anxiety to retain him, but quietly told
him of some of the consequences of removing, so it is gone
out of his mind. But Mirza happened to hear all Sabat&rsquo;s
querulous harangue, and, in order to vex and disgust him
effectually, rode almost into his house, and came in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
his shoes. This irritated the Arab; but Mirza&rsquo;s purpose
was not answered. Mirza began next day to tell a parcel
of lies about Sabat, and to bring proofs of his own learning.
The manifest tendency of all this was to make a division
between Sabat and me, and to obtain his <i>salary</i> and work
for himself. Oh, the hypocrisy and wickedness of an
Indian! I never saw a more remarkable contrast in two
men than in Mirza and Sabat. One is all exterior&mdash;the
other has no outside at all; one a most consummate man
of the world&mdash;the other an artless child of the desert.</p>

<p><i>March 28.</i>&mdash;Sabat has been tolerably quiet this week;
but think of the keeper of a lunatic, and you see me. A
war of words broke out the beginning of last week, but it
ended in an honourable peace. After he got home at night
he sent a letter, complaining of a high crime and misdemeanour
in some servant; I sent him a soothing letter,
and the wild beast fell asleep. In all these altercations we
take occasion to consider the extent of Christian forbearance,
as necessary to be exercised in all the smaller
occasions of life, as well as when persecution comes for
religion. This he has not been hitherto aware of. One
night in prayer I forgot to mention Mr. Brown; so, after I
had done, he continued on his knees and went on and
prayed in Persian for him. I was much pleased at this.</p>

<p>Did you read Lord Minto&rsquo;s speech, and his commendation
of those <i>learned and pious men</i>, the missionaries? I
have looked upon him ever since as a nursing-father to the
Church.</p>

<p><i>April 11.</i>&mdash;It is surprising that a man can be so blinded
by vanity as to suppose, as Sabat does, that he is superior to
Mirza in Hindustani; yet this he does, and maintains it
stoutly. I am tired of combating this opinion, as nothing
comes of our arguments but strifes. Another of his odd
opinions is, that he is so under the immediate influence
and direction of the Spirit, that there will not be one single
error in his whole Persian translation. You perceive a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
enthusiasm in the character of our brother. As often as
he finds himself in any difficulty, he expects a dream to set
him right.</p>

<p><i>April 26.</i>&mdash;These Orientals with whom I translate require
me to point out the connection between every two
sentences, which is often more than I can do. It is
curious how accurately they observe all the rules of writing,
and yet generally write badly. I can only account for it
by supposing that they have been writing too long. From
time immemorial they have been authors, without progressive
knowledge; and so to produce variety they supply
their lack of knowledge by overstraining their imagination;
hence their extravagant metaphors and affected way of
expressing the commonest things. Sabat, though a real
Christian, has not lost a jot of his Arabian pride. He looks
upon the Europeans as mushrooms, and seems to regard
my pretensions to any learning as we do those of a savage
or an ape.</p>

<p><i>May 31.</i>&mdash;Some days Sabat overworked himself and
was laid up. He does his utmost. He is increasingly
dear to me, as I see more of the meekness and gentleness
of Christ in him. Our conflicts I hope are over, and we
shall draw very quietly together side by side.</p></div>

<p>In all this, and much more that followed, or is unrecorded,
Henry Martyn was being prepared unconsciously
for his formal and unanswered controversies with the
learned Mussulmans of Persia. His letters to Corrie tell
of his farther experience with his moonshis and the
moulvies of Patna, and describe the true spirit of such
&lsquo;disputings&rsquo; for the truth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1807, April 28.</i>&mdash;Of what importance is our walk in
reference to our ministry, and particularly among the
natives. For myself, I never enter into a dispute with
them without having reason to reflect that I mar the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
for which I contend by the spirit in which I do it. During
my absence at Monghyr moonshi went to a learned
native for assistance against an answer I had given him to
their main argument for the Koran, and he not being able
to render it, they mean to have down their leading man
from Benares to convince me of the truth of their religion.
I wish a spirit of inquiry may be excited, but I lay not
much stress upon <i>clear arguments</i>; the work of God is
seldom wrought in this way. To preach the Gospel, with
the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, is a better way to
win souls.</p>

<p><i>May 4.</i>&mdash;I am preparing for the assault of this great
Mohammedan Imaum. I have read the Koran and notes
twice for this purpose, and even filled whole sheets with
objections, remarks, questions, etc.; but, alas! what little
hopes have I of doing him or any of them good in this way!
Moonshi is in general mute.</p>

<p><i>October 28.</i>&mdash;At night, in a conversation with Mirza
accidentally begun, I spoke to him for more than three
hours on Christianity and Mohammedanism. He said
there was no passage in the Gospel that said no prophet
shall come after Christ. I showed him the last verse in
Matthew, the passages in Isaiah and Daniel, on the eternity
of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, and proved it from the nature of the
way of salvation in the Gospel. I then told him my objections
against Mohammedanism, its laws, its defects, its
unnecessariness, the unsuitableness of its rewards, and its
utter want of support by proof. When he began to
mention Mahomet&rsquo;s miracles, I showed him the passages
in the 6th and 13th chapters of the Koran, where he
disavows the power. Nothing surprised him so much as
these passages; he is, poor man, totally indifferent about
all religion; he told me that I had produced great doubt
in his mind, and that he had no answer to give.</p>

<p><i>November 21.</i>&mdash;My mind violently occupied with
thoughts respecting the approaching spread of the Gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and my own going to Persia. Sabat&rsquo;s conversation stirs
up a great desire in me to go; as by his account all the
Mahometan countries are ripe for throwing off the delusion.
The gracious Lord will teach me, and make my way plain
before my face. Oh, may He keep my soul in peace, and
make it indifferent to me whether I die or live, so Christ
be magnified by me. I have need to receive this spirit
from Him, for I feel at present unwilling to die, as if my
own life and labours were necessary for this work, or as if
I should be deprived of the bliss of seeing the conversion
of the nations. Vain thought! God, who keeps me here
awhile, arranges every part of His plans in unerring wisdom,
and if I should be cut off in the midst of my plans, I
shall still, I trust, through mercy, behold His works in
heaven, and be everlastingly happy in the never-ceasing
admiration of His works and nature. Every day the disputes
with Mirza and Moorad Ali become more interesting.
Their doubts of Mahometanism seem to have amounted
almost to disbelief. Moorad Ali confessed that they all
received their religion, not on conviction, but because it
was the way of their fathers; and he said with great
earnestness, that if some great Sheikh-ool-Islam, whom he
mentioned, could not give an answer, and a satisfactory,
rational evidence, of the truth of Islamism, he would
renounce it and be baptized. Mirza seemed still more
anxious and interested, and speaks of it to me and Sabat
continually. In translating 1 Timothy i. 15, I said to
them, &lsquo;You have in that verse heard the Gospel; your blood
will not be required at my hands; you will certainly
remember these words at the last day.&rsquo; This led to a long
discussion, at the close of which, when I said that, notwithstanding
their endeavours to identify the two religions, there
is still so much difference &lsquo;that if our word is true you are
lost,&rsquo; they looked at each other almost with consternation, and
said &lsquo;It is true.&rsquo; Still the Trinity and the incarnation of
Christ afford a plea to the one, and a difficulty to the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>At another time, when I had, from some passage,
hinted to Mirza his danger, he said with great earnestness,
&lsquo;Sir, why won&rsquo;t you try to save me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Save you?&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;I would lay down my life to save your soul: what can I
do?&rsquo; He wished me to go to Phoolwari, the Mussulman
college, and there examine the subject with the most
learned of their doctors. I told him I had no objection
to go to Phoolwari, but why could not he as well inquire
for himself whether there were any evidence for
Mohammedanism?</p>

<p><i>1808, June 14.</i>&mdash;Called on Bahir Ali Khan, Dare, and
the Italian padre; with Bahir Ali I stayed two hours, conversing
in Persian. He began our theological discussion
with a question to me, &lsquo;How do you reconcile God&rsquo;s absolute
power and man&rsquo;s free will?&rsquo; I pleaded ignorance and inability,
but he replied to his own question very fully, and
his conclusion seemed to be that God had created evil
things for the trial of His creatures. His whole manner,
look, authority, and copiousness constantly reminded me
of the Dean of Carlisle.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I asked him for the proofs of
the religion of Mahomet. The first he urged was the
eloquence of the Koran. After a long time he conceded
that it was, of itself, an insufficient argument. I then
brought forward a passage of the Koran containing a sentiment
manifestly false; on which he floundered a good
deal; but concluded with saying that I must wait till I
knew more of logic and Persian before he could explain
it to me satisfactorily. On the whole, I was exceedingly
pleased with his candour, politeness, and good sense. He
said he had nothing to lose by becoming a Christian, and
that, if he were once persuaded of the truth, he would
change without hesitation. He showed me an Arabic
translation of Euclid.</p>

<p><i>June 15.</i>&mdash;Read an account of Turkey. The bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
effects of the book were so great that I found instant need
of prayer, and I do not know when I have had such divine
and animating feelings. Oh, it is Thy Spirit that makes
me pant for the skies. It is He that shall make me trample
the world and my lusts beneath my feet, and urge my onward
course towards the crown of life.</p>

<p><i>December 5.</i>&mdash;Went to Patna to Sabat, and saw several
Persians and Arabians. I found that the intended dispute
had come to nothing, for that Ali had told Sabat he had
been advised by his father not to dispute with him. They
behaved with the utmost incivility to him, not giving him
a place to sit down, and desiring him at last to go. Sabat
rose, and shook his garment against them, and said, &lsquo;If you
know Mohammedanism to be right, and will not try to convince
me, you will have to answer for it at the day of judgment.
I have explained to you the Gospel; I am therefore
pure from your blood.&rsquo; He came home and wrote some
poetry on the Trinity, and the Apostles, which he recited
to me. We called on Mizra Mehdi, a jeweller, who showed
us some diamonds, emeralds, and rubies. With an old
Arabian there I tried to converse in Arabic. He understood
my Arabic, but I could not understand his. They
were all full of my praise, but then the pity was that I was
a Christian. I challenged them to show what there was
wrong in being a Nazarene, but they declined. Afterwards
we called on the nabob Moozuffur Ali Khan. The
house Sabat lived in was properly an Oriental one; and, as
he said, like those in Syria. It reminded me often of the
Apostles, and the recollection was often solemnising.</p>

<p><i>December 6 to 8.</i>&mdash;Betrayed more than once into evil
temper, which left dreadful remorse of conscience; I cried
unto God in secret, but the sense of my sinfulness was overwhelming.
It had a humbling effect, however. In prayer
with my men I was led more unfeignedly to humble
myself even to the dust, and after that I enjoyed, through
the sovereign mercy of God, much peace, and a sense of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
presence. Languid in my studies; indisposition causing
sleepiness. Reading chiefly Persian and a little Greek:
Hanway, Waring, and Franklin&rsquo;s Travels into Persia.
Haji Khan, a sensible old man from Patna, called two
days following, and sat a long time conversing upon
religion.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Mrs. Dare, Gaya</span></p>
<p class="date">
Dinapore: May 19, 1808.
</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Dare,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;Your letter arrived just in time to save
you from some severe animadversions that were preparing
for you. I intended to have sent by your young friend
some remarks, direct and oblique, on the variableness of
the sex, the facility with which promises are made and
broken, the pleasures of indolence, and other topics of the
like nature,&mdash;but your kind epistle disarms me. Soon after
you left us, the heat increased to a degree I had never
before felt, and made me often think of you with concern.
I used to say to Colonel Bradshaw, &lsquo;I wonder how Mrs.
Dare likes Gya, and its burning hills&mdash;I dare say she
would be glad to be back again.&rsquo; Well, I should be
glad if we had you here again. I want female society,
and among the ladies of Dinapore there is none with whom
I have a chance of obtaining a patient hearing when
speaking to them on the subject of their most important
interest. This, you know, is the state of all but Mrs.
Stuart, and it is a state of danger and death. Follow them
no more, my dear friend: but now, in the solitude of Gya,
learn those lessons of heavenly wisdom, that, when you are
brought again into a larger society, you may not yield to
the impulse of doing as others do, but, by a life of true
seriousness, put them to shame.</p>

<p>I go on much as usual, occupied all day, and laying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
weary head on the pillow at night. My health, which
you inquire after so kindly, is on the whole good; but
I am daily reminded that it is a fragile frame I carry
about.</p>

<p><i>August 23.</i>&mdash;I rejoice to find by your letter that you
are contented with your lot. Before the time of Horace,
and since too, contentment has been observed to be a very
rare thing on earth, and I know not how it is to be obtained
but by learning in the school of the Gospel. &lsquo;I have <i>learned</i>,&rsquo;
said even St. Paul, &lsquo;in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.&rsquo; To be a little slanderous for once, I suspect
Colonel Bradshaw, our common friend, who will send you
a letter by the same sepoy, must have a lecture or two
more read to him in this science, as he is far from being
perfect in it. He has, you know, all that heart can wish
of this world&rsquo;s goods, and yet he is restless; sometimes the
society is dull; at other times the blame is laid on the
quarters, and he must go out of cantonments. To-day he
is going to Gya, to-morrow on the river. Now, I tell him
that he need not change his place, but his heart. Let him
seek his happiness in God, and he will carry about a paradise
in his own bosom. <i>The wilderness and the solitary
place shall be glad for him, and the desert shall rejoice and
blossom as the rose.</i></p>

<p><i>September 23.</i>&mdash;My dear Mrs. Dare, attend to the call
of God; He never speaks more to the heart than by
affliction. Such a season as this, so favourable to the
commencement of true piety, may never again occur.
Hereafter time may have riveted worldly habits on you,
and age rendered the heart insensible. Begin now to be
melancholy? No&mdash;to be seriously happy, to be purely
happy, everlastingly happy.</p></div>

<p>Ever, through the solitude, the suffering, and the toiling
of the first twelve months at Dinapore, the thought of
Lydia Grenfell, the hope of her union to him, and her help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in his agonising for India, runs like a chord of sad music.
He thus writes to his cousin, her sister:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Indeed, all my Europe letters this season have
brought me such painful news that I almost dread receiving
another. Such is the vanity of our expectations. I had
been looking out with more than ordinary anxiety for
these letters, thinking they would give me some account
of Lydia&rsquo;s coming&mdash;whereas yours and hers have only
wounded me, and my sister&rsquo;s,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> giving me the distressing
tidings of her ill-health, makes my heart bleed. Oh, it is
now that I feel the agony of having half the globe intervening
between us. Could I but be with her: yet God
who heareth prayer will surely supply my place. From
Sally I expect neither promptness nor the ability to console
her sister. This is the first time Sally has taken up her
pen to write to me, and thought an apology necessary for
her neglect. Perhaps she has been wrapt up in her dear
husband, or her dearer self. I feel very angry with her.
But my dear faithful Lydia has more than compensated
for all the neglect of my own relations. I believe
she has sent me more than all the rest in England put
together. If I had not loved her before, her affectionate
and constant remembrance of me would win my heart.</p>

<p>You mention the name of your last little one (may she
be a follower of her namesake!). It reminds me of what
Mr. Brown has lately written to me. He says that Mrs.
B. had determined her expected one should be called after
me: but, as it proved to be a girl, it was called <i>Lydia
Martyn Brown</i>, a combination that suggests many reflections
to my mind.</p>

<p>And now I ought to begin to write about myself and
India: but I fear you are not so interested about me as
you used to be: yet the Church of God, I know, is dear to
you always! Let me speak of the ministers. The Gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was preached before the Governor-General by seven different
evangelical chaplains in the course of six months. Of
these five have associated, agreeing to communicate with
each other quarterly reports of their proceedings. They
are Mr. Brown at Calcutta, Thompson at Cuddalore,
Parson at Berhampore, Corrie at Chunar, and myself here.
Corrie and myself, as being most similarly employed,
correspond every week. He gives all his attention to the
languages, and has his heart wholly towards the heathen.
He has set on foot four schools in his neighbourhood, and
I four here along the banks of the Ganges, containing 120
boys: he has nearly the same number. The masters are
heathens&mdash;but they have consented with some reluctance
to admit the Christian books. The little book on the
Parables in the dialect of Bihar, which I had prepared for
them, is now in the press at Serampore; for the present,
they read with their own books the Sermon on the
Mount. We hope by the help of God to enlarge the plan
of the schools very considerably, as soon as we have felt
the ground, and can advance boldly.</p>

<p>Respecting my own immediate plans, I am rather in
the dark. They wish to engage me as a translator of the
Scriptures into Hindustani and Persian, by the help of
some learned natives; and if this plan is settled at Calcutta,
I shall engage in it without hesitation, as conceiving it to
be the most useful way in which I can be employed at
present in the Church of God. If not, I hope to begin to
itinerate as soon as the rains are over; not that I can hope
to be easily understood yet, but by mixing familiarly with
the natives I should soon learn. Little permanent good,
however, can be done till some of the Scriptures can be put
into their hands. On this account I wish to help forward
this work as quick as possible, because a chapter will speak
plainly in a thousand places at once, while I can speak,
and not very plainly, but in one. One advantage attending
the delay of public preaching will be that the schools will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
have a fair run, for the commencement of preaching will be
the downfall of the schools. I have my tent ready, and
would set out with pleasure to-morrow if the time for this
work were come. As there is public service here every
Lord&rsquo;s Day, three days&rsquo; journey is the longest I can take.
This may hereafter prove an inconvenience: but the advantages
of being a Company&rsquo;s servant are incalculable.
A missionary not in the service is liable to be stopped by
every subaltern; but there is no man that can touch me.
Amongst the Europeans at this station I am not without
encouragement. Eight or ten, chiefly corporals or sergeants,
come to my quarters Sunday and Wednesday nights for
social worship: but it does not appear that more than one
are truly converted. The commanding officer of the native
battalion and his lady, whom I mentioned in my last, are,
I think, increasingly serious&mdash;but the fear of man is their
snare. Mrs. Young says that, with Lydia to support her,
she could face the frown of the world. I had been looking
forward with pleasure to the time when she <i>would</i> have such
support, and rejoiced that Lydia would have so sensible
and hopeful a companion.</p>

Dinapore: December, 1807.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear Cousin,&mdash;Your letter, after so long a silence,
was a great relief to me, as it assured me of your undiminished
affection; but I regretted you had been so
sparing in your consolations on the subject of my late
disappointment. Remember, it was to you I used to
unbosom all my anxieties, and I still look to you for that
sympathising tenderness which no other person perhaps
feels for me, or at least can venture to express. How
every particular of our conversation in the journey from
Redruth to Plymouth Dock returns to my mind! I have
reason indeed to remember it&mdash;from that time I date my
sorrows&mdash;we talked too much about Lydia. Her last
letter was to bid me a final farewell, so I must not write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to her without her permission; she wished she might hear
by you that I was happy. I am therefore obliged to say
that God has, according to her prayer, kept me in peace,
and indeed strengthened me unto all patience and long-suffering
with joyfulness. At first, like Jonah, I was more
grieved at the loss of my gourd than at the sight of the
many perishing Ninevehs all round me; but now my
earthly woes and earthly attachments seem to be absorbing
in the vast concern of communicating the Gospel to these
nations. After this last lesson from God on the vanity of
creature love, I feel desirous to be nothing, to have nothing,
to ask for nothing, but what He gives. So remarkably and
so repeatedly has He baffled my schemes of earthly
comfort that I am forced at last to believe His determination
to be, that I should live in every sense a
stranger and pilgrim on the earth. Lydia allows me not
the most distant prospect of ever seeing her; and if indeed
the supposed indelicacy of her coming out to me is an
obstacle that cannot be got over, it is likely indeed to be a
lasting separation: for when shall I ever see it lawful to
leave my work here for three years, when every hour is
unspeakably precious? I am beginning therefore to form
my plans as a person in a state of celibacy, and mean to
trouble you no more on what I have been lately writing
about so much. However, let me be allowed to make one
request; it is that Lydia would at least consider me as she
did before, and write as at that time. Perhaps there may
be some objection to this request, and therefore I dare not
urge it. I say only that by experience I know it will
prove an inestimable blessing and comfort to me. If you
really wish to have a detailed account of my proceedings,
exert your influence in effecting this measure; for you
may be sure that I shall be disposed to write to <i>her</i> letters
long enough, longer than to any other, for this reason
among others, that of the three in the world who have
most love for me, <i>i.e.</i> Sally, Lydia, and yourself, I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that, notwithstanding all that has happened, the middle
one loves most truly. If this conjecture of mine is well-founded,
she will be most interested in what befalls me,
and I shall write in less fear of tiring. My bodily health,
which you require me always to mention, is prodigious, my
strength and spirits are in general greater than ever they
were, and this under God I ascribe to the susceptibility of
my frame, giving me instant warning of anything that may
disorder it. Half-an-hour&rsquo;s exposure to the sun produces
an immediate overflow of bile: therefore I take care never
to let the sun&rsquo;s rays fall upon my body. Vexation or
anxiety has the same effect. For this, faith and prayer
for the peace of God are the best remedy.</p>

<p>Since my last letter, written a few months ago in reply
to Cousin T., I do not recollect that anything has happened.
Dr. Buchanan&rsquo;s last publication on the Christian Institution
will give you the most full and interesting accounts of the
affairs of our Lord&rsquo;s kingdom in India. The press seems
to us all to be the great instrument at present. Preaching
by the European Mission here has in no instance that I
know of been successful. Everything in our manner,
pronunciation, and doctrine is so new and strange, that to
instruct them properly <i>vivâ voce</i> seems to be giving more
time to a small body of them than can be conveniently
spared from the great mass. Yet, on the other hand, I feel
reason to be guarded against the love of carnal ease, which
would make me prefer the literary work of translating to
that of an itinerant: upon the whole, however, I acquiesce
in the work that Dr. B. has assigned me, from conviction.
Through the blessing of God I have finished the New
Testament in the Perso-Arabic-Hindustani, but it must
undergo strict revisal before it can be sent to the press.
My assistants in this work were Mirza Mahommed Ali
and Moorad Ali, two Mahometans, and I sometimes hope
there are convictions in their minds which they will not
be able to shake off. They have not much doubt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
falsehood of Mahometanism, and the truth of the Gospel,
but they cannot take up the cross.</p>

<p>The arrival of Jawad Sabat, our Arabian brother, at
Dinapore, had a great effect upon them.... He is now
employed in translating the New Testament into Persian
and Arabic, and great will be the benefit to his own soul,
that he is called to study the Word of God: the Bible
Society at home will, I hope, bear the expense of printing
it. This work, whenever it is done properly, will be the
downfall of Mahometanism. What do I not owe to the
Lord for giving me to take part in a translation? Never
did I see such wonders of wisdom and love in the blessed
book, as since I have been obliged to study every expression;
and it is often a delightful reflection, that even
death cannot deprive us of the privilege of studying its
mysteries.... I forgot to mention Lydia&rsquo;s profile, which
I received. I have now to request her miniature picture,
and you must draw on Mr. Simeon, my banker, for the
expense.... I need not assure you and Cousin T. of my
unceasing regard, nor Lydia of my unalterable attachment.
God bless you all, my beloved friends. Pray for me, as I
do also for you. Our separation will soon be over.</p>

<p><i>July 3.</i>&mdash;Received two Europe letters&mdash;one from
Lydia, and the other from Colonel Sandys. The tender
emotions of love, and gratitude, and veneration for her,
were again powerfully awakened in my mind, so that I
could with difficulty think of anything else; yet I found
myself drawn nearer to God by the pious remarks of her
letter. Nature would have desired more testimonies of
her love to me, but grace approved her ardent love to her
Lord.</p>

<p>My dearest Friend and Brother,&mdash;I must begin my letter
with assurances of eternal regard; eternal will it be if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
find grace to be faithful.... My expectation of seeing
Lydia here is now at an end. I cannot doubt any longer
what is the Divine will, and I bow to it. Since I have
been led to consider myself as perfectly disengaged from
the affairs of this life, my soul has been filled with more
ardent desires to spend and be spent in the service of God;
and though in truth the world has now little to charm me,
I think these desires do not arise from a misanthropic
disgust to it.... I never loved, nor ever shall love, human
creature as I love her.</p></div>

<p>Soon after David Brown of Calcutta wrote to Charles
Simeon, whom a rumour of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s engagement to
Miss Corrie, his friend&rsquo;s sister, had reached: &lsquo;How could you
imagine that Miss C. would do as well as Miss L.G. for
Mr. Martyn? Dear Martyn is married already to three
wives, whom, I believe, he would not forsake for all the
princesses in the earth&mdash;I mean his three translations of
the Holy Scriptures.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To Mrs. Brown at Aldeen, who was his confidante in
India, Martyn wrote on July 21:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It appears that the letter by the overland despatch did
not reach Lydia. Again, the Sarah Christiana packet,
which carried the duplicate, ought to have arrived long
before the sailing of these last ships from England, but I
see no account of her. It is probable, therefore, that I
shall have to wait a considerable time longer in uncertainty;
all which is good, because so hath the Lord appointed
it.</p>

<p><i>July 25.</i>&mdash;Hard at Arabic grammar all day, after
finishing sermon. Sat in the evening a long time at my
door, after the great fatigue of the day, to let my mind
relax itself, and found a melancholy pleasure in looking
back upon the time spent at St. Hilary and Marazion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
How the days and years are gone by, as a tale that is

<p>At last the blow had fallen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>October 24.</i>&mdash;An unhappy day: received at last a letter
from Lydia, in which she refuses to come because her
mother will not consent to it. Grief and disappointment
threw my soul into confusion at first, but gradually as my
disorder subsided my eyes were opened, and reason
resumed its office. I could not but agree with her that it
would not be for the glory of God, nor could we expect
His blessing, if she acted in disobedience to her mother.
As she has said, &lsquo;They that walk in crooked paths shall
not find peace;&rsquo; and if she were to come with an uneasy
conscience, what happiness could we either of us expect?</p>

<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Lydia Grenfell</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
Dinapore: October 24, 1807.
</p>

<p>My dear Lydia,&mdash;Though my heart is bursting with
grief and disappointment, I write not to blame you. The
rectitude of all your conduct secures you from censure.
Permit me calmly to reply to your letter of March 5, which
I have this day received.</p>

<p>You condemn yourself for having given me, though
unintentionally, encouragement to believe that my attachment
was returned. Perhaps you have. I have read your
former letters with feelings less sanguine since the receipt
of the last, and I am still not surprised at the interpretation
I put upon them. But why accuse yourself for having
written in this strain? It has not increased my expectations
nor consequently embittered my disappointment.
When I addressed you in my first letter on the subject, I
was not induced to it by any appearances of regard you
had expressed, neither at any subsequent period have my
hopes of your consent been founded on a belief of your
attachment to me. I knew that your conduct would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
regulated, not by personal feelings, but by a sense of duty.
And therefore you have nothing to blame yourself for on
this head.</p>

<p>In your last letter you do not assign among your
reasons for refusal a want of regard to me. In that case
I could not in decency give you any further trouble. On
the contrary, you say that &lsquo;<i>present</i> circumstances seem to
you to forbid my indulging expectations.&rsquo; As this leaves
an opening, I presume to address you again; and till the
answer arrives must undergo another eighteen months of
torturing suspense.</p>

<p>Alas! my rebellious heart&mdash;what a tempest agitates
me! I knew not that I had made so little progress in a
spirit of resignation to the Divine will. I am in my
chastisement like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke,
like a wild bull in a net, full of the fury of the Lord, the
rebuke of my God. The death of my late most beloved
sister almost broke my heart; but I hoped it had softened
me and made me willing to suffer. But now my heart is
as though destitute of the grace of God, full of misanthropic
disgust with the world, and sometimes feeling resentment
against yourself and Emma, and Mr. Simeon, and, in short,
all whom I love and honour most; sometimes, in pride
and anger, resolving to write neither to you nor to any one
else again. These are the motions of sin. My love and
my better reason draw me to you again.... But now
with respect to your mother, I confess that the chief and
indeed only difficulty lies here. Considering that she is
<i>your</i> mother, as I hoped she would be mine, and that her
happiness so much depends on you; considering also that
I am God&rsquo;s minister, which amidst all the tumults of my
soul I dare not forget, I falter in beginning to give
advice which may prove contrary to the law of God. God
forbid, therefore, that I should say, disobey your parents,
where the Divine law does not command you to disobey
them; neither do I positively take upon myself to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
that this is a case in which the law of God requires you to
act in contradiction to them. I would rather suggest to
your mother some considerations which justify me in attempting
to deprive her of the company of a beloved child.</p>

<p><i>October 26.</i>&mdash;A Sabbath having intervened since the
above was written, I find myself more tranquillised by the
sacred exercises of the day. One passage of Scripture
which you quote has been much on my mind, and I find it
very appropriate and decisive,&mdash;that we are not to &lsquo;make to
ourselves crooked paths, which whoso walketh in shall not
know peace.&rsquo; Let me say I must be therefore contented to
wait till you feel that the way is clear. But I intended to
justify myself to Mrs. Grenfell. Let her not suppose that I
would make her or any other of my fellow-creatures miserable,
that I might be happy. If there were no reason for
your coming here, and the contest were only between Mrs.
Grenfell and me, that is, between her happiness and mine,
I would urge nothing further, but resign you to her. But
I have considered that there are many things that might
reconcile her to a separation from you (if indeed a separation
is necessary, for if she would come along with you, I
should rejoice the more). First, she does not depend on
you alone for the comfort of her declining years. She is
surrounded by friends. She has a greater number of sons
and daughters honourably established in the world than falls
to the lot of most parents&mdash;all of whom would be happy
in having her amongst them. Again, if a person worthy
of your hand, and settled in England, were to offer himself,
Mrs. Grenfell would not have insuperable objections,
though it <i>did</i> deprive her of her daughter. Nay, I sometimes
think, perhaps arrogantly, that had I myself remained
in England, and in possession of a competency, she would
not have withheld her consent. Why, then, should my
banishment from my native country, in the service of mankind,
be a reason with any for inflicting an additional wound,
far more painful than a separation from my dearest relatives?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>I have no claim upon Mrs. Grenfell in any way, but let
her only conceive a son of her own in my circumstances.
If she feels it a sacrifice, let her remember that it is a
sacrifice made to duty; that your presence here would be
of essential service to the Church of God it is superfluous
to attempt to prove. If you really believe of yourself as
you speak, it is because you were never out of England.</p>

<p>Your mother cannot be so misinformed respecting
India and the voyage to it as to be apprehensive on account
of the climate or passage, in these days when multitudes
of ladies every year, with constitutions as delicate as yours,
go to and fro in perfect safety, and a vastly greater majority
enjoy their health here than in England. With respect to
my means I need add nothing to what was said in my first
letter. But, alas! what is my affluence good for now? It
never gave me pleasure but when I thought you were to
share it with me. Two days ago I was hastening on the
alterations in my house and garden, supposing you were at
hand; but now every object excites disgust. My wish,
upon the whole, is that if you perceive it would be your
duty to come to India, were it not for your mother&mdash;and
of that you cannot doubt&mdash;supposing, I mean, that your
inclinations are indifferent, then you should make her
acquainted with your thoughts, and let us leave it to God
how He will determine her mind.</p>

<p>In the meantime, since I am forbidden to hope for the
immediate pleasure of seeing you, my next request is for a
mutual engagement. My own heart is engaged, I believe,
indissolubly.</p>

<p>My reason for making a request which you will account
bold is that there can then be no possible objection to our
correspondence, especially as I promise not to persuade
you to leave your mother.</p>

<p>In the midst of my present sorrow I am constrained
to remember yours. Your compassionate heart is pained
from having been the cause of suffering to me. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
care not for me, dearest Lydia. Next to the bliss of
having you with me, my happiness is to know that you
are happy. I shall have to groan long, perhaps, with a
heavy heart; but if I am not hindered materially by it
in the work of God, it will be for the benefit of my soul.
You, sister beloved in the Lord, know much of the benefit
of affliction. Oh, may I have grace to follow you, though
at a humble distance, in the path of patient suffering, in
which you have walked so long! Day and night I cease
not to pray for you, though I fear my prayers are of little
value.</p>

<p>But, as an encouragement to you to pray, I cannot help
transcribing a few words from my journal, written at the
time you wrote your letter to me (March 7): &lsquo;As on the
two last days&rsquo; (you wrote your letter on the 5th), &lsquo;felt no
desire for a comfortable settlement in the world, scarcely
pleasure at the thought of Lydia&rsquo;s coming, except so far as
her being sent might be for the good of my soul and
assistance in my work. How manifestly is there an omnipresent,
all-seeing God, and how sure we may be that
prayers for spiritual blessings are heard by our God and
Father! Oh, let that endearing name quell every murmur!
When I am sent for to different parts of the country to
officiate at marriages, I sometimes think, amidst the
festivity of the company, Why does all go so easily with
them, and so hardly with me? They come together without
difficulty, and I am baulked and disconcerted almost
every step I take, and condemned to wear away the time
in uncertainty. Then I call to mind that to live without
chastening is allowed to the spurious offspring, while to
suffer is the privilege of the children of God.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dearest Lydia, must I conclude? I could prolong my
communion with you through many sheets; how many
things have I to say to you, which I hoped to have communicated
in person. But the more I write and the more
I think of you, the more my affection warms, and I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
feel it difficult to keep my pen from expressions that might
not be acceptable to you.</p>

<p>Farewell! dearest, most beloved Lydia, remember your
faithful and ever affectionate,</p>

<p><i>October 25.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached on Isaiah lii. 13 to a
large congregation, my mind continually in heaviness, and
my health disturbed in consequence. The women still
fewer than ever at Hindustani prayer, and, at night, some
of the men who were not on duty did not come; all these
things are deeply afflicting, and yet my heart is so full of
its own griefs, that I mourn not as I ought for the Church
of God. I have not a moment&rsquo;s relief from my burdens
but after being some time in prayer; afterwards my uneasiness
and misery return again.</p>

<p><i>October 26.</i>&mdash;Mirza from Benares arrived to-day; I

employment to me. I felt more submission to the Divine
will, and began to be more solicitous about Lydia&rsquo;s peace

<p>My dear Sir,&mdash;I have received your two letters of the
14th and 17th; the last contained a letter from Lydia. It
is as I feared. She refuses to come because her mother
will not give her consent. Sir, you must not wonder at
my pale looks when I receive so many hard blows on my
heart. Yet a Father&rsquo;s love appoints the trial, and I pray
that it may have its intended effect. Yet, if you wish to
prolong my existence in this world, make a representation
to some persons at home who may influence her friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Your word will be believed sooner than mine. The extraordinary
effect of mental disorder on my bodily frame is
unfortunate; trouble brings on disease and disorders the
sleep. In this way I am labouring a little now, but not
much; in a few days it will pass away again. He that
hath delivered and doth deliver, is He in whom we trust
that He will yet deliver.</p>

<div class="tb">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The queen&rsquo;s ware on its way to me can be sold at an
outcry or sent to Corrie. I do not want queen&rsquo;s ware
or anything else now. My new house and garden,
without the person I expected to share it with me, excite
disgust.</p>

<p><i>November 25.</i>&mdash;Letters came from Mr. Simeon and
Lydia, both of which depressed my spirits exceedingly;
though I have been writing for some days past, that I
might have it in my power to consider myself free, so as to
be able to go to Persia or elsewhere;&mdash;yet, now that the
wished-for permission is come, I am filled with grief; I
cannot bear to part with Lydia, and she seems more
necessary to me than my life; yet her letter was to bid
me a last farewell. Oh, how have I been crossed from
childhood, and yet how little benefit have I received from
these chastisements of my God! The Lord now sanctify
this, that since the last desire of my heart also is withheld,
I may with resignation turn away for ever from the world,
and henceforth live forgetful of all but God. With Thee,
O my God, there is no disappointment; I shall never
have to regret that I loved Thee too well. Thou hast said,
&lsquo;Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the
desires of thine heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>November 26.</i>&mdash;Received a letter from Emma, which
again had a tendency to depress my spirits; all the day I
could not attain to sweet resignation to God. I seemed to
be cut off for ever from happiness in not having Lydia with
me.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The receipt of his letter of October 24, 1807, was thus
acknowledged, before God, by Lydia Grenfell in her
<i>Diary</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1808, May 9.</i>&mdash;A letter from my dear friend in India
(requesting me to come out) reached me. These words
form my comfort: &lsquo;Be still, and know that I am God.&rsquo; I
see my duty pointed out, and am persuaded, dark as the
prospect is, God will appear God in this matter; whether
we meet again or not, His great power and goodness will
be displayed&mdash;it has been in quieting my heart, for oh,
the trial is not small of seeing the state of his mind. But
I am to be still, and now, O Lord, let Thy love fill my soul,
let it be supreme in his breast and mine; there is no void
where Thou dwellest, whatever else is wanting.</p>

<p><i>May 11.</i>&mdash;My mind distressed, perplexed, and troubled
for my dear friend; much self-reflection for having suffered
him to see my regard for him (and what it is), yet the
comforts of God&rsquo;s Word return&mdash;&lsquo;Why take ye thought?&rsquo;
said our Lord. Yet to-morrow burdens the present day.
Oh, pity and support me to bear the thought of injuring his
peace&mdash;inquire if the cause is of God.</p>

<p><i>May 15.</i>&mdash;Lord, Thou seest my wanderings&mdash;oh, how
many, how great! Put my tears into Thy bottle. Yes,
my Lord, I can forsake Thee and be content; I turn and
turn, restless and miserable, till I am turned to Thee.
What a week have I passed! never may such another pass
over my head!&mdash;my thoughts wholly occupied about my
absent friend&mdash;distressed for his distress, and full of self-reproaches
for all that&rsquo;s past&mdash;writing bitter things against
myself&mdash;my heart alienated dreadfully from God&mdash;and the
duties I am in the habit of performing all neglected. Oh,
should the Lord not awake for me and draw me back,
whither should I go? His Word has been my comfort at
times, but Satan or conscience (I doubt which) tells me I
am in a delusion to take the comfort of God&rsquo;s Word, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
ought to suffer. But am I justified in putting comfort from
me? since I no way excuse myself, but am, I trust, humbled
for my imprudence in letting my friend know the
state of mind towards him, and this is all I have injured
him in. I accuse myself, too, for want of candour with my
family, and oh, let me not forget the greatest offence of all&mdash;not
consulting the will and glory of God in indulging and
encouraging a regard He seems to frown on. I have
to-day found deliverance, and felt some measure of calm
reliance. I know there is a particular providence over him
and me, but this belief does not lessen my fears of acting
wrong&mdash;I am as responsible as if all were left to me.
What shall I do but say, Because Thou hast been my help,
therefore in the shadow of Thy wings will I trust? I fly
to Thy power and take shelter in Thy love to sinners. Oh,
for a continually bleeding heart, mourning for sin!</p>

<p><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;I have peace in my soul to-day. My remembrance
of God&rsquo;s dear saint in India is frequent, but
I am still in this affair, and expect to know more of the
infinite power, wisdom, and goodness of our God in it and
by it than I have heretofore. My prayer for him constantly
is that he maybe supported, guided, and made in all things
obedient and submissive to the will of his God.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn seems to have written again to Marazion,
at this time, a letter which has not been preserved, for
Lydia Grenfell thus refers to it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>August 29.</i>&mdash;Heard of my absent dear friend by this
day&rsquo;s post, and was strangely affected, though the intelligence
was satisfactory in every respect. I sought deliverance
in prayer, and the Lord spoke peace to my agitated
mind, and gave me what I desired&mdash;liberty of soul to
return to Himself, and the contemplation of heavenly
things, though a sadness remained on my spirit. Heard
three sermons, for I thought it best to be less alone than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
usual, lest my thoughts should wander. Found great hardness
of heart in the services of the day, but I doubt
whether my affections were spiritual or not, though they
arose from a longing to be in heaven, and a joyful sense
of the certainty that God would bring me there.</p>

<p><i>September 11.</i>&mdash;After some days of darkness and distress,
sweet peace and light return, and my soul rests on
God as my all-sufficient help. Oh, the idolatrous state of
my heart! what painful discoveries are made to me! I
see the stream of my affections has been turned from God
and on.... An exertion must be made, like cutting
off a right hand, in order to give Thee, O Lord, my heart.
I must hear neither of nor from the person God has called
in His providence to serve Him in a distant country. Oh,
to be resolute, knowing by woeful experience the necessity
of guarding my thoughts against the remembrance of one,
though dear. As I value the presence of my God, I must
avoid everything that leads my thoughts to this subject&mdash;O
Lord, keep me dependent on Thee for grace to do so;
Thou hast plainly informed me of Thy will by withholding
Thy presence at this time, and Thy Word directed me to
lay aside this weight.</p>

<p><i>October 30.</i>&mdash;Thought of my dear friend to-night with
tenderness, but entire resignation to Thy will, O our God,
in never seeing or hearing from him again; to meet him
above is my desire.</p>

<p><i>December 30.</i>&mdash;I reckon among my mercies the Lord&rsquo;s
having enabled me to choose a single life, and that my
friend in India has been so well reconciled to my determination.
That trial was a sore one, and I believe the effects
of it will be felt as long as I live. My weak frame could
not support the perturbed state of my mind, and the
various painful apprehensions that assailed me on his
arrival nearly wore me down. But the Lord removed
them all by showing me He approved of my choice, and
in granting me the tidings of his enjoying peace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
happiness in our separation. Every burden now respecting
him is removed, and my soul has only to praise the wise
and gracious hand which brought me through that thorny
path. It was one I made to myself, by ever entering into
a correspondence with him, and by expressing too freely
my regard.</p></div>

<p>On March 28, 1809, Martyn wrote to Mr. Brown:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your letter is just come. The Europe letter is from
Lydia. I trembled at the handwriting.... It was only
more last words, sent by the advice of Colonel Sandys, lest
the non-arrival of the former might keep me in suspense....
I trust that I have done with the entanglements of
this world; seldom a day passes but I thank God for the
freedom from earthly care which I enjoy.</p></div>

<p>And so end Henry Martyn&rsquo;s love-letters, marked by a
delicacy as well as tenderness of feeling in such contrast to
the action of Lydia Grenfell throughout, as to explain the
mingled resentment and resignation in which they close.
The request for a mutual engagement which would justify
correspondence at least seems to have been unheeded for
some months, till the news of his serious illness in July
1808 led her again to write to him, as taking the place
of his sister who had been removed by death. He was
ordered to Cawnpore, and set off in the hot season by Chunar
and Ghazipore, writing these last words on April 11, 1809,
from Dinapore:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My men seem to be in a more flourishing state than
they have yet been. About thirty attend every night. I
had a delightful party this week, of six young men, who
will, I hope, prove to be true soldiers of Christ. Seldom,
even at Cambridge, have I been so much pleased.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="subheading">CAWNPORE, 1809-1810</p>


<p>Mrs. Sherwood, known in the first decade of this century
as a writer of such Anglo-Indian tales as <i>Little Henry
and his Bearer</i>, and as a philanthropist who did much for
the white and the dark orphans of British soldiers in India,
was one of the many who came under the influence of
Henry Martyn. This Lichfield girl, whose father had been
the playmate of Samuel Johnson, and who had known
Garrick and Dr. Darwin, Hannah More and Maria
Edgeworth, had married her cousin, the paymaster of the
King&rsquo;s 53rd Regiment of Foot. The regiment was sent
to Bengal. On its way up the Hoogli from Calcutta
in boats, Mr. Sherwood and his wife were walking after
sunset, when they stumbled on &lsquo;a small society&rsquo; of their
own men, who met regularly to read their Bibles and to pray,
often in old stores, ravines, woods, and other retired places.
&lsquo;The very existence of any person in the barracks who
had the smallest notion of the importance of religion was
quite unsuspected by me,&rsquo; writes Mrs. Sherwood in her
Autobiography.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> &lsquo;I am not severe when I assert that at
that time there really was not one in the higher ranks in
the regiment who had courage enough to come forward and
say, &ldquo;I think it right, in this distant land, to do, as it regards
religion, what I have been accustomed to do at home.&rdquo;&rsquo;
At Berhampore, the chaplain, Mr. Parson, began that good
work in the 53rd which Martyn and Corrie afterwards
carried on. When it continued the voyage up the Ganges,
after a season, by Dinapore to Cawnpore, Mr. Parson gave
the Sherwoods a letter of introduction to Martyn, then
about to leave Dinapore. To this fact we owe the fullest
and the brightest glimpses that we get of Henry Martyn,
from the outside, all through his career. We are enabled to
supplement the abasing self-revelation of his nature before
God, as recorded in his <i>Journal</i>, by the picture of his daily
life, drawn by a woman of keen sympathy and some
shrewdness.</p>

<p>The moment the boat anchored at Dinapore Mr.
Sherwood set out on foot to present his letter. He found
the chaplain in the smaller square, at some distance, in a
&lsquo;sort of church-like abode with little furniture, the rooms
wide and high, with many vast doorways, having their green
jalousied doors, and long verandahs encompassing two
sides of the quarters.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Martyn received Mr. Sherwood not as a stranger,
but as a brother,&mdash;the child of the same father. As the
sun was already low, he must needs walk back with him to
see me. I perfectly remember the figure of that simple-hearted
and holy young man, when he entered our
budgerow. He was dressed in white, and looked very pale,
which, however, was nothing singular in India; his hair, a
light brown, was raised from his forehead, which was a
remarkably fine one. His features were not regular, but
the expression was so luminous, so intellectual, so
affectionate, so beaming with Divine charity, that no one
could have looked at his features, and thought of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
shape or form,&mdash;the out-beaming of his soul would absorb the
attention of every observer. There was a very decided air,
too, of the gentleman about Mr. Martyn, and a perfection
of manners which, from his extreme attention to all minute
civilities, might seem almost inconsistent with the general
bent of his thoughts to the most serious subjects. He was
as remarkable for ease as for cheerfulness, and in these
particulars his <i>Journal</i> does not give a graphic account of
this blessed child of God. I was much pleased at the first
sight of Mr. Martyn. I had heard much of him from Mr.
Parson; but I had no anticipation of his hereafter
becoming so distinguished as he subsequently did. And
if I anticipated it little, he, I am sure, anticipated it less;
for he was one of the humblest of men.</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn invited us to visit him at his quarters at
Dinapore, and we agreed to accept his invitation the next
day. Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s house was destitute of every comfort,
though he had multitudes of people about him. I had
been troubled with a pain in my face, and there was not
such a thing as a pillow in the house. I could not find
anything to lay my head on at night but a bolster stuffed
as hard as a pin-cushion. We had not, as is usual in India,
brought our own bedding from the boats. Our kind friend
had given us his own room; but I could get no rest during
the two nights of my remaining there, from the pain in my
face, which was irritated by the bolster; but during each
day, however, there was much for the mind to feed upon
with delight. After breakfast Mr. Martyn had family
prayers, which he commenced by singing a hymn. He had
a rich, deep voice, and a fine taste for vocal music. After
singing, he read a chapter, explained parts of it, and prayed
extempore. Afterwards he withdrew to his studies and translations.
The evening was finished with another hymn, Scripture
reading, and prayers. The conversion of the natives
and the building up of the kingdom of Christ were the great
objects for which alone that child of God seemed to exist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>He believed that he saw the glimmering of this day in
the exertions then making in Europe for the diffusion of
the Scriptures and the sending forth of missionaries.
Influenced by the belief that man&rsquo;s ministry was the
instrumentality which, by the Holy Spirit, would be made
effectual to the work, we found him labouring beyond his
strength, and doing all in his power to excite other persons
to use the same exertions.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn was one of the very few persons whom I
have ever met who appeared never to be drawn away from
one leading and prevailing object of interest, and that
object was the promotion of religion. He did not appear
like one who felt the necessity of contending with the
world, and denying himself its delights, but rather as one
who was unconscious of the existence of any attractions
in the world, or of any delights which were worthy of his
notice. When he relaxed from his labours in the presence
of his friends, it was to play and laugh like an innocent,
happy child, more especially if children were present to
play and laugh with him. In my Indian Journal I find
this remark: &lsquo;Mr. Martyn is one of the most pleasing, mild,
and heavenly-minded men, walking in this turbulent world
with peace in his mind, and charity in his heart.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>As the regiment was passing Chunar, after a night in
&lsquo;the polluted air&rsquo; of Benares, the Sherwoods were met by
a boat with fresh bread and vegetables from Corrie. On
their arrival at Cawnpore, Mrs. Sherwood at once opened two
classes for the &lsquo;great boys&rsquo; and &lsquo;elder girls.&rsquo; Many of the
former died in a few years, and not a few of the latter married
officers above their own birth. Such were the conditions of
military life in India at that time, notwithstanding the
Calcutta Orphan Schools which David Brown had first gone
out to India to organise; for Henry Lawrence and his noble
wife, Honoria, with their Military Orphan Asylums in the
hills, belonged to a later generation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>When first ordered to Cawnpore, in the hottest months
of 1809, Henry Martyn resolved to apply to the Military
Board for permission to delay his departure till the rainy
season. But, though even then wasted by consumption
and ceaseless toil, and tempted to spend the dreary months
with the beloved Corrie at Chunar, as he might well have
done under the customary rules, he could not linger when
duty called. Had he not resolved to &lsquo;burn out&rsquo; his life?
So, deluding himself by the intention to &lsquo;stay a little longer
to recruit&rsquo; at Chunar, should he suffer from the heat, he
set off in the middle of April in a palanquin by Arrah, afterwards
the scene of a heroic defence in the great Mutiny;
Buxar, where a battle had been fought not long before,
and Ghazipore, seat of the opium manufacture, like Patna.
Sabat was sent on in a budgerow, with his wife Ameena
and the baggage. This is Martyn&rsquo;s account, to Brown, of
the voyage above Chunar:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date">
Cawnpore: May 3, 1809.
</p>

<p>I transported myself with such rapidity to this place
that I had nearly transported myself out of the world.
From Dinapore to Chunar all was well, but from Allahabad
to that place I was obliged to travel two days and nights
without intermission, the hot winds blowing like fire
from a furnace. Two days after my arrival the fever
which had been kindling in my blood broke out, and last
night I fainted repeatedly. But a gracious God has again
interposed to save my life; to-day I feel well again. Where
Sabat is I do not know. I have heard nothing of him
since leaving Dinapore. Corrie is well, but it is grievous
to see him chained to a rock with a few half-dead invalids,
when so many stations&mdash;amongst others, the one I have
left&mdash;are destitute....</p>

<p>I do not like this place at all. There is no church,
not so much as the fly of a tent; what to do I know not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
except to address Lord Minto in a private letter. Mr.
(Charles) Grant, who is anxious that we should labour
principally for the present among the Europeans, ought,
I think, to help us with a house. I mean to write to
Mr. Simeon about this.</p>

<p>I feel a little uncomfortable at being so much farther
removed from Calcutta. At Dinapore I had friends on
both sides of me, and correspondence with you was quick:
here I seem cut off from the world. Alas! how dependent
is my heart upon the creature still. I am ordered to seal
up.&mdash;Yours affectionately ever,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">H. Martyn.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>This is Mrs. Sherwood&rsquo;s description of his arrival:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On May 30 the Rev. Henry Martyn arrived at our bungalow.
The former chaplain had proceeded to the presidency,
and we were so highly favoured as to have Mr. Martyn
appointed in his place. I am not aware whether we expected
him, but certainly not at the time when he did appear. It
was in the morning, and we were situated as above described,
the desert winds blowing like fire without, when we suddenly
heard the quick steps of many bearers. Mr. Sherwood
ran out to the leeward of the house, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Mr.
Martyn!&rsquo; The next moment I saw him leading in that
excellent man, and saw our visitor, a moment afterwards,
fall down in a fainting fit. He had travelled in a palanquin
from Dinapore, and the first part of the way he moved only
by night. But between Cawnpore and Allahabad, being a
hundred and thirty miles, there is no resting-place, and he
was compelled for two days and two nights to journey on
in his palanquin, exposed to the raging heat of a fiery wind.
He arrived, therefore, quite exhausted, and actually under
the influence of fever. There was not another family in
Cawnpore except ours to which he could have gone with
pleasure; not because any family would have denied
shelter to a countryman in such a condition, but, alas! they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
were only Christians in name. In his fainting state Mr.
Martyn could not have retired to the sleeping-room which
we caused to be prepared immediately for him, because we
had no means of cooling any sleeping-room so thoroughly
as we could the hall. We, therefore, had a couch set for
him in the hall. There he was laid, and very ill he was for
a day or two. The hot winds left us, and we had a close,
suffocating calm. Mr. Martyn could not lift his head from
the couch. In our bungalow, when shut up as close as
it could be, we could not get the thermometer under 96°,
though the punkah was constantly going. When Mr.
Martyn got a little better he became very cheerful, and
seemed quite happy with us all about him. He commonly
lay on his couch in the hall during the morning, with many
books near to his hand, and amongst these always a Hebrew
Bible and a Greek Testament. Soon, very soon, he began
to talk to me of what was passing in his mind, calling to
me at my table to tell me his thoughts. He was studying
the Hebrew characters, having an idea, which I believe is
not a new one, that these characters contain the elements
of all things, though I have reason to suppose he could not
make them out at all to his satisfaction; but whenever
anything occurred to him he must needs make it known
to me.</p>

<p>He was much engaged also with another subject, into
which I was more capable of entering. It was his opinion
that, if the Hindus could be persuaded that all nations are
made of one blood, to dwell upon the face of the earth, and
if they could be shown how each nation is connected by its
descent from the sons and grandsons of Noah with other
nations existing upon the globe, it would be a means
of breaking down, or at least of loosening, that wall of
separation which they have set up between themselves and
all other people. With this view Mr. Martyn was endeavouring
to trace up the various leading families of the earth
to their great progenitors; and so much pleased was I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
with what he said on this subject, that I immediately committed
all I could remember to paper, and founded thereupon
a system of historical instruction which I ever afterwards
used with my children. Mr. Martyn, like myself at
this time, was often perplexed and dismayed at the workings
of his own heart, yet, perhaps, not discerning a hundredth
part of the depth of the depravity of his own nature, the
character of which is summed up in Holy Writ in these two
words&mdash;&lsquo;utterly unclean.&rsquo; He felt this the more strongly
because he partook also of that new nature &lsquo;which sinneth
not.&rsquo; It was in the workings and actings of that nature
that his character shone so pre-eminently as it did amid a
dark and unbelieving society, such as was ours then at
Cawnpore.</p>

<p>In a very few days he had discerned the sweet qualities
of the orphan Annie, and had so encouraged her to come
about him that she drew her chair, and her table, and her
green box to the vicinity of his couch. She showed him
her verses, and consulted him about the adoption of more
passages into the number of her favourites. Annie had a
particular delight in all the pastoral views given in Scripture
of our Saviour and of His Church; and when Mr. Martyn
showed her this beautiful passage, &lsquo;Feed Thy people with
Thy rod, the flock of Thine heritage, which dwell solitarily
in the wood, in the midst of Carmel&rsquo; (Micah vii. 14), she
was as pleased with this passage as if she had made some
wonderful acquisition. What could have been more
beautiful than to see the Senior Wrangler and the almost
infant Annie thus conversing together, whilst the elder
seemed to be in no ways conscious of any condescension in
bringing down his mind to the level of the child&rsquo;s? Such
are the beautiful influences of the Divine Spirit, which,
whilst they depress the high places of human pride, exalt
the lowly valleys.</p>

<p>When Mr. Martyn lost the worst symptoms of his illness
he used to sing a great deal. He had an uncommonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
fine voice and fine ear; he could sing many fine chants,
and a vast variety of hymns and psalms. He would insist
upon it that I should sing with him, and he taught me
many tunes, all of which were afterwards brought into
requisition; and when fatigued himself, he made me sit by
his couch and practise these hymns. He would listen to
my singing, which was altogether very unscientific, for
hours together, and he was constantly requiring me to go
on, even when I was tired. The tunes he taught me, no
doubt, reminded him of England, and of scenes and friends
no longer seen. The more simple the style of singing, the
more it probably answered his purpose.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Martyn could in any way exert himself,
he made acquaintance with some of the pious men of the
regiment (the same poor men whom I have mentioned
before, who used to meet in ravines, in huts, in woods, and
in every wild and secret place they could find, to read, and
pray, and sing); and he invited them to come to him in
our house, Mr. Sherwood making no objection. The time
first fixed was an evening after parade, and in consequence
they all appeared at the appointed hour, each carrying
their mora (a low seat), and their books tied up in pocket-handkerchiefs.
In this very unmilitary fashion they were
all met in a body by some officers. It was with some
difficulty that Mr. Sherwood could divert the storm of
displeasure which had well-nigh burst upon them on the
occasion. Had they been all found intoxicated and
fighting, they would have created less anger from those
who loved not religion. How truly is it said that &lsquo;the
children of this world are wiser in their generation than
the children of light.&rsquo; Notwithstanding this unfortunate
<i>contretemps</i>, these poor good men were received by Mr.
Martyn in his own apartment; and a most joyful meeting
he had with them. We did not join the party, but we
heard them singing and praying, and the sound was very
sweet. Mr. Martyn then promised them that when he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
got a house he would set aside a room for them, where
they might come every evening, adding he would meet
them himself twice in the week. When these assemblies
were sanctioned by our ever kind Colonel Mawby, and all
difficulties, in short, overcome, many who had been the
most zealous under persecution fell quite away, and never
returned. How can we account for these things? Many,
however, remained steadfast under evil report as well as
good report, and died, as they had lived, in simple and
pure faith.</p>

<p>I must not omit another anecdote of Mr. Martyn,
which amused us much at the time, after we had recovered
the alarm attending it. The salary of a chaplain is large,
and Mr. Martyn had not drawn his for so long a time, that
the sum amounted perhaps to some hundreds. He was to
receive it from the collector at Cawnpore. Accordingly
he one morning sent a note for the amount, confiding the
note to the care of a common coolie, a porter of low caste,
generally a very poor man. This man went off, unknown
to Mr. Sherwood and myself, early in the morning. The
day passed, the evening came, and no coolie arrived. At
length Mr. Martyn said in a quiet voice to us, &lsquo;The coolie
does not come with my money. I was thinking this
morning how rich I should be; and, now, I should not
wonder in the least if he has not run off, and taken my
treasure with him.&rsquo; &lsquo;What!&rsquo; we exclaimed, &lsquo;surely you
have not sent a common coolie for your pay?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have,&rsquo;
he replied. Of course we could not expect that it would
ever arrive safe; for it would be paid in silver, and delivered
to the man in cotton bags. Soon afterwards, however, it did
arrive&mdash;a circumstance at which we all greatly marvelled.</p></div>

<p>Cawnpore, of which Henry Martyn was chaplain for
the next two years, till disease drove him from it, was the
worst station to which he could have been sent. The
district, consisting of clay uplands on the Doab between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the Ganges and the Jumna rivers, which unite below at
Allahabad, was at that time a comparatively desolate
tract, swept by the hot winds, and always the first to suffer
from drought. The great famine of 1837 afterwards so
destroyed its unhappy peasantry and labourers, that the
British Government made its county town one of the two
terminals of the great Ganges canal, which the Marquis of
Dalhousie opened, and irrigated the district by four
branches with their distributing channels. Even then,
and to this day, Cawnpore has not ceased to be a repulsive
station. Its leather factories and cotton mills do not
render it less so, nor the memory of the five massacres of
British officers, their wives and children, by the infamous
Nana Dhoondoo Panth, which still seems to cover it as
with a pall, notwithstanding the gardens and the marble
screen inclosing the figure of the Angel of the Resurrection
with the palm of victory above the Massacre Well. The
people of the town at least have always been disagreeable,
from Hindu discontent and Mohammedan sulkiness.
The British cantonment used to be at Bilgram, on the
opposite bank, in the territory of Oudh. Well might
Martyn write of such a station as Cawnpore: &lsquo;I do not
like this place at all,&rsquo; although he then enjoyed the social
ministrations of the Sherwoods, and was constant in his
own service to the Master among British and natives alike,
and at his desk in translation work.</p>

<p>The first use which the chaplain made of his pay was
this, according to Mrs. Sherwood: &lsquo;Being persuaded by
some black man, he bought one of the most undesirable
houses, to all appearance, which he could have chosen.&rsquo;
But he had chosen wisely for his daily duties of translation
and preaching to the natives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s house was a bungalow situated between
the Sepoy Parade and the Artillery Barracks, but behind
that range of principal bungalows which face the Parade.
The approach to the dwelling was called the Compound,
along an avenue of palm trees and aloes. A more stiff,
funereal avenue can hardly be imagined, unless it might be
that one of noted sphynxes which I have read of as the
approach to a ruined Egyptian temple. At the end of this
avenue were two bungalows, connected by a long passage.
These bungalows were low, and the rooms small. The
garden was prettily laid out with flowering shrubs and
tall trees; in the centre was a wide space, which at some
seasons was green, and a <i>chabootra</i>, or raised platform of
chunam (lime), of great extent, was placed in the middle
of this space. A vast number and variety of huts and
sheds formed one boundary of the compound; these were
concealed by the shrubs. But who would venture to give
any account of the heterogeneous population which occupied
these buildings? For, besides the usual complement of
servants found in and about the houses of persons of a
certain rank in India, we must add to Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s household
a multitude of pundits, moonshis, schoolmasters,
and poor nominal Christians, who hung about him because
there was no other to give them a handful of rice for their
daily maintenance; and most strange was the murmur
which proceeded at times from this ill-assorted and discordant
multitude. Mr. Martyn occupied the largest of
the two bungalows. He had given up the least to the
wife of Sabat, that wild man of the desert whose extraordinary
history has made so much noise in the Christian
world.</p>

<p>It was a burning evening in June, when after sunset I
accompanied Mr. Sherwood to Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s bungalow, and
saw for the first time its avenue of palms and aloes. We
were conducted to the <i>chabootra</i>, where the company was
already assembled; there was no lady but myself. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<i>chabootra</i> was many feet square, and chairs were set for the
guests. A more heterogeneous assembly surely had not often
met, and seldom, I believe, were more languages in requisition
in so small a party. Besides Mr. Martyn and ourselves,
there was no one present who could speak English. But
let me introduce each individual separately. Every feature
in the large disk of Sabat&rsquo;s face was what we should call
exaggerated. His eyebrows were arched, black, and strongly
pencilled; his eyes dark and round, and from time to time
flashing with unsubdued emotion, and ready to kindle into
flame on the most trifling occasion. His nose was high,
his mouth wide, his teeth large, and looked white in
contrast with his bronzed complexion and fierce black
mustachios. He was a large and powerful man, and
generally wore a skull-cap of rich shawling, or embroidered
silk, with circular flaps of the same hanging over each
ear. His large, tawny throat and neck had no other
covering than that afforded by his beard, which was black.
His attire was a kind of jacket of silk, with long sleeves,
fastened by a girelle, or girdle, about his loins, to which
was appended a jewelled dirk. He wore loose trousers,
and embroidered shoes turned up at the toes. In the cold
season he threw over this a wrapper lined with fur, and
when it was warmer the fur was changed for silk. When
to this costume is added ear-rings, and sometimes a golden
chain, the Arab stands before you in his complete state of
Oriental dandyism. This son of the desert never sat in a
chair without contriving to tuck up his legs under him on
the seat, in attitude very like a tailor on his board. The
only languages which he was able to speak were Persian,
Arabic, and a very little bad Hindustani; but what was
wanting in the words of this man was more than made up
by the loudness with which he uttered them, for he had a
voice like rolling thunder. When it is understood that loud
utterance is considered as an ingredient of respect in the
East, we cannot suppose that one who had been much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
native courts should think it necessary to modulate his
voice in the presence of the English Sahib-log.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The second of Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s guests, whom I must
introduce as being not a whit behind Sabat in his own
opinion of himself, was the Padre Julius Cæsar, an
Italian monk of the order of the Jesuits, a worthy disciple
of Ignatius Loyola. Mr. Martyn had become acquainted
with him at Patna, where the Italian priest was not less
zealous and active in making proselytes than the Company&rsquo;s
chaplain, and probably much more wise and subtle in his
movements than the latter. The Jesuit was a handsome
young man, and dressed in the complete costume of the
monk, with his little skull-cap, his flowing robes, and his
cord. The materials, however, of his dress were very rich;
his robe was of the finest purple satin, and his cord of
twisted silk, and his rosary of costly stones, whilst his air
and manner were extremely elegant. He spoke French
fluently, and there Mr. Sherwood was at home with him,
but his native language was Italian. His conversation
with Mr. Martyn was carried on partly in Latin and partly
in Italian. A third guest was a learned native of India, in
his full and handsome Hindustani costume; and a fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
a little, thin, copper-coloured, half-caste Bengali gentleman,
in white nankeen, who spoke only Bengali. Mr.
Sherwood made a fifth, in his scarlet and gold uniform;
myself, the only lady, was the sixth; and add our host, Mr.
Martyn, in his clerical black silk coat, and there is our
party. Most assuredly I never listened to such a confusion
of tongues before or since. Such a noisy, perplexing Babel
can scarcely be imagined. Everyone who had acquired
his views of politeness in Eastern society was shouting at
the top of his voice, as if he had lost his fellow in a wood;
and no less than eight languages were in constant request,
viz. English, French, Italian, Arabic, Persian, Hindustani,
Bengali, and Latin.</p>

<p>In order to lengthen out the pleasures of the evening,
we were scarcely seated before good Mr. Martyn recollected
that he had heard me say that I liked a certain sort of
little mutton pattie, which the natives made particularly
well; so, without thinking how long it might take to make
these same patties, he called to a servant to give orders
that mutton patties should be added to the supper. I
heard the order, but never dreamed that perhaps the
mutton might not be in the house. The consequence of
this order was that we sat on the <i>chabootra</i> till it was quite
dark, and till I was utterly weary with the confusion.
No one who has not been in or near the tropics can have
an idea of the glorious appearance of the heavens in these
regions, and the brilliancy of the star-lit nights, at Cawnpore.
Mr. Martyn used often to show me the pole-star,
just above the line of the horizon; and I have seen the
moon, when almost new, looking like a ball of ebony in
a silver cup. Who can, therefore, be surprised that the
science of astronomy should first have been pursued by
the shepherds who watched their flocks by night in the
plains of the South? When the mutton patties were
ready, I was handed by Mr. Martyn into the hall of the
bungalow. Mr. Martyn took the top of the table, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Sabat perched himself on a chair at the bottom. I think
it was on this day, when at table, Sabat was telling some
of his own adventures to Mr. Martyn, in Persian, which
the latter interpreted to Mr. Sherwood and myself, that the
wild Arab asserted that there were in Tartary and Arabia
many persons converted to Christianity, and that many
had given up their lives for the faith. He professed to be
himself acquainted with two of these, besides Abdallah.
&lsquo;One,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;was a relation of his own.&rsquo; But he gave
but small proof of this man&rsquo;s sincerity. This convert, if
such he was, drew the attention of the priests by a total
neglect of all forms; and this was the more remarkable
on account of the multiplied forms of Islam; for at the
wonted hour of prayer a true Mussulman must kneel
down and pray in the middle of a street, or between the
courses of a feast, nay, even at the moment when perhaps
his hands might be reeking with a brother&rsquo;s blood. This
relative of Sabat&rsquo;s, however, was, as he remarked, observed
to neglect all forms, and he was called before the heads of
his tribe, and required to say wherefore he was guilty of
this offence. His answer was, &lsquo;It is nothing.&rsquo; He proceeded
to express himself as if he doubted the very
existence of a God. The seniors of the tribe told him
that it would be better for him to be a Christian than an
atheist; adding, therefore, &lsquo;If you do not believe in our
prophet you must be a Christian;&rsquo; for they wisely accounted
that no man but a fool could be without some
religion. The man&rsquo;s reply was, that he thought the
Christian&rsquo;s a better religion than that of Mahomet; the
consequence of which declaration was that they stoned
him until he died. The other example which Sabat gave
us was of a boy in Baghdad, who was converted by an Armenian,
and endeavoured to escape, but was pursued, seized,
and offered pardon if he would recant; but he was preserved
in steadfastness to the truth, and preferred death to returning
to Mahometanism. His life was required of him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>From the time Mr. Martyn left our house he was
in the constant habit of supping with us two or three
times a week, and he used to come on horseback, with the
sais running by his side. He sat his horse as if he were
not quite aware that he was on horseback, and he
generally wore his coat as if it were falling from his
shoulders. When he dismounted, his favourite place was
in the verandah, with a book, till we came in from our
airing. And when we returned many a sweet and long
discourse we had, whilst waiting for our dinner or supper.
Mr. Martyn often looked up to the starry heavens, and
spoke of those glorious worlds of which we know so little
now, but of which we hope to know so much hereafter.
Often we turned from the contemplation of these to the
consideration of the smallness, and apparent diminutiveness
in creation, of our own little globe, and of the
exceeding love of the Father, who so cared for its
inhabitants that He sent His Son to redeem them.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the baptism of my second Lucy,
never can I forget the solemn manner with which Mr.
Martyn went through the service, or the beautiful and
earnest blessing he implored for my baby, when he took
her into his arms after the service was concluded. I still
fancy I see that child of God as he looked down tenderly
on the gentle babe, and then looked upwards, asking of
his God that grace and mercy for the infant which he truly
accounted as the only gift which parents ought to desire.
This babe, in infancy, had so peculiar a gentleness of
aspect, that Mr. Martyn always called her Serena.</p>

<p>Little was spoken of at Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s table but of
various plans for advancing the triumphs of Christianity.
Among the plans adopted, Mr. Martyn had, first at
Dinapore and then at Cawnpore, established one or two
schools for children of the natives of the lower caste. His
plan was to hire a native schoolmaster, generally a Mussulman,
to appoint him a place, and to pay him an anna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
(1&frac12;<i>d.</i>) a head for each boy whom he could induce to
attend school. These boys the master was to teach to
write and read. It was Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s great aim, and,
indeed, the sole end of his exertions, to get Christian
books into the school. As no mention was ever made
of proselytism, there was never any difficulty found in
introducing even portions of the Scripture itself, more
especially portions of the Old Testament, to the attention
of the children. The books of Moses are always very
acceptable to a Mussulman, and Genesis is particularly
interesting to the Hindus. Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s first school at
Cawnpore was located in a long shed, which was on the
side of the cavalry lines. It was the first school of the
kind I ever saw. The master sat at one end, like a tailor,
on the dusty floor; and along under the shed sat the
scholars, a pack of little urchins, with no other clothes on
than a skull-cap and a piece of cloth round the loins.
These little ones squatted, like their master, in the sand.
They had wooden imitations of slates in their hands, on
which, having first written their lessons with chalk, they
recited them, <i>à pleine gorge</i>, as the French would say, being
sure to raise their voices on the approach of any European
or native of note. Now, Cawnpore is about one of the
most dusty places in the world. The Sepoy lines are the
most dusty part of Cawnpore; and as the little urchins
are always well greased, either with cocoanut oil or, in
failure thereof, with rancid mustard oil, whenever there
was the slightest breath of air they always looked as if
they had been powdered all over with brown powder. But
what did this signify? They would have been equally dusty
in their own huts. In these schools they were in the way
of getting a few ideas; at all events, they often got so far
as to be able to copy a verse on their wooden slates.
Afterwards they committed to memory what they had
written. Who that has ever heard it can forget the sounds
of the various notes with which these little people intonated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
their &lsquo;Aleph Zubbur ah&mdash;Zair a&mdash;Paiche oh,&rsquo; as they
waved backwards and forwards in their recitations? Or
who can forget the vacant self-importance of the schoolmaster,
who was generally a long-bearded, dry old man,
who had no other means of proving his superiority over
the scholars but making more noise than even they could
do? Such a scene, indeed, could not be forgotten; but
would it not require great faith to expect anything green
to spring from a soil so dry? But this faith was not
wanting to the Christians then in India.</p></div>

<p>Besides the 53rd Regiment, the Cavalry Corps called in
those days the 8th Light Dragoons, and six companies of
Artillery, were stationed at Cawnpore. At the first parade
service, on May 15, 1809, &lsquo;two officers dropped down and
some of the men. They wondered how I could go through
the fatigue,&rsquo; wrote their new chaplain, not many days after
his nearly fatal palanquin journey from Chunar. His
voice even reached the men at the other end of the square
which they had formed. Above a hundred men were in
hospital, a daily congregation. Every night about a dozen
of the soldiers met with him in the house. Not only the
men but the officers were privately rebuked by him for
swearing. Of the General he writes: &lsquo;He has never been
very cordial, and now he is likely to be less so; though it
was done in the gentlest way, he did not seem to like it.
Were it not to become all things to all men in order to save
some, I should never trouble them with my company. But
how then should I be like Christ? I have been almost the
whole morning engaged in a good-humoured dispute with
Mrs. P., who, in an instant after my introduction to
her, opened all her guns of wit and eloquence against me
for attempting to convert the Brahmans.&rsquo; A little later he
writes of a dinner at the brigade-major&rsquo;s with the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
persons of the station: &lsquo;I could gain no attention while
saying grace; and the moment the ladies withdrew the
conversation took such a turn that I was obliged to make
a hasty retreat. Oh! the mercy to have escaped their
evil ways.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The year was one of alarms of war, from which the
history of our Indian Empire can rarely be free, surrounded
as it is by a ring-fence of frontier tribes and often aggressive
States. But in those days the great internal conflicts for
the consolidation of our power, and the peace and prosperity
of peoples exposed to anarchy for centuries, were still being
waged. Marathas, Sikhs, and Goorkhas had all to be
pacified in 1809. Now the infantry were being sent to the
conquest of Bundlekhund and difficult siege of the fortress
of Kalinjar, as old as the Mahabharat Epic in which it is
mentioned. Now the artillery were under orders to march
to Lodiana to check Ranjeet Singh. Now the cavalry were
sent off to the, at first, fatal chase of the Goorkhas by
Gillespie. Thus it was that their ever-careful chaplain
sought to prepare them for the issue:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>October 20.</i>&mdash;Spoke to my men on preparation for the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and endeavoured to prepare myself for the
ordinance, by considering my former life of sin, and all my
unfaithfulness since my call to the Gospel. My heart was,
as usual, insensible for a long time, but at last a gracious
God made me feel some compunction, and then my feelings
were such as I would wish they always were. I resolved
at the time that it should be my special labour every day
to obtain, and hold fast, this humbling view of my own
depravity.</p>

<p><i>October 22.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached at sunrise to the
53rd, on Acts xxviii. 29. At ten, about sixteen of the
regiment, with Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood and Sabat, met in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
bungalow, where, after a short discourse on &lsquo;Behold the
Lamb of God,&rsquo; we commemorated the death of the Lord.
It was the happiest season I have yet had at the Lord&rsquo;s
Table, though my peace and pleasure were not unalloyed;
the rest of the day I felt weak in body, but calm in mind,
and rather spiritual; at night I spoke to the men on Rev.
xxii. 2; the number was double; afterwards had some conversation
on eternal things, but had reason to groan at the
hollow-heartedness and coldness with which I do my best
works.</p>

<p><i>November 18.</i>&mdash;At night I took leave of my beloved
Church previous to their departure for Bundlekhund with
their regiment. I spoke to them from Gen. xxviii: &lsquo;I will
be with thee in all places whithersoever thou goest,&rsquo; etc.
The poor men were much affected; they gave me their wills
and watches.</p>

<p><i>November 19.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached at sunrise to the
dragoons, on John i. 17: &lsquo;The law was given by Moses.&rsquo; At
eleven at head-quarters, on Rom. iii. 19.</p></div>

<p>Nowhere are eucharistic seasons of communion so
precious as in exile, and especially in the isolation of a
tropical station. Not unfrequently in India, Christian people,
far separated from any ordained minister, and about to
part from each other, are compelled, by loving obedience
to the Lord, to meet thus together. But what joy it
must have been to have been ministered to at such times
by one of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s consecrated saintliness! Mrs.
Sherwood lingers over her description of that Cawnpore
service of October 22, 1809&mdash;the long inner verandah of
the house, where daily prayer was wont to be made, shut in
by lofty doors of green lattice-work; the table, with the
white cloth and all things requisite, at one end; hassocks
on which to kneel, and a high form in front of the table;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
all &lsquo;decent and in good order, according to the forms of
the Church of England.&rsquo; Still there was no church
building. His first parade service in the hot winds
brought on fever, so that he proposed to ask for the billiard-room,
&lsquo;which is better than the ball-room,&rsquo; but in vain.
His next service was in the riding-school, but &lsquo;the effluvium
was such as would please only the knights of the turf.
What must the Mohammedans think of us? Well may
they call us &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; when even in Divine worship we choose
to kennel ourselves in such places.&rsquo; The General delayed
to forward to Government the proposal for a church.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s missionary work among the natives
became greatly extended at Cawnpore, as his scrupulous
conscience and delicate scholarship allowed him to use in
public the colloquial Hindustani, and in conversation the
more classical Persian. To Corrie he wrote, five months
after his arrival there:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What will friends at home think of Martyn and
Corrie? They went out full of zeal, but, behold! what are
they doing? Where are their converts? They talked of
the banyan-tree before they went out; but now they seem
to prefer a snug bungalow to field-preaching. I fear I
should look a little silly if I were to go home just at this
time; but more because I should not be able to make
them understand the state of things than because my
conscience condemns me. Brother, what can you do? If
you itinerate like a European, you will only frighten the
people; if as a native, you will be dead in one year. Yet
the latter mode pleases me, and nothing would give me
greater pleasure than so to live, with the prospect of being
able to hold out a few years.</p></div>

<p>Again, to an old Cambridge friend:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><i>November, 1809.</i>&mdash;Respecting my heart, about which
you ask, I must acknowledge that H. Martyn&rsquo;s heart at
Dinapore is the same as H. Martyn&rsquo;s heart at Cambridge.
The tenor of my prayer is nearly the same, except on one
subject, the conversion of the heathen. At a distance from
the scene of action, and trusting too much to the highly-coloured
description of missionaries, my heart used to
expand with rapture at the hope of seeing thousands of the
natives melting under the Word as soon as it should be
preached to them. Here I am called to exercise faith&mdash;that
so it shall one day be. My former feelings on this
subject were more agreeable, and at the same time more
according with the truth; for if we believe the prophets,
the scenes that time shall unfold, &lsquo;though surpassing fable,
are yet true.&rsquo; While I write, hope and joy spring up in
my mind. Yes, it shall be; yonder stream of Ganges
shall one day roll through tracts adorned with Christian
churches, and cultivated by Christian husbandmen, and the
holy hymn be heard beneath the shade of the tamarind.
All things are working together to bring on the day, and
my part in the blessed plan, though not at first exactly
consonant to my wishes, is, I believe, appointed me by
God. To translate the Word of God is a work of more
lasting benefit than my preaching would be. But, besides
that, I am sorry to say that my strength for public
preaching is almost gone. My ministrations among the
Europeans at this station have injured my lungs, and I am
now obliged to lie by except on the Sabbath days, and
once or twice in the week.... However, I am sufficiently
aware of my important relations to the natives, and am
determined not to strain myself any more for the
Europeans. This rainy season has tried my constitution
severely. The first attack was with spasms, under which I
fainted. The second was a fever, from which a change of
air, under God, recovered me. There is something in the
air at the close of the rains so unfavourable, that public
speaking at that time is a violent strain upon the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
body. Corrie passed down a few weeks ago to receive his
sister. We enjoyed much refreshing communion in prayer
and conversation on our dear friends at and near Cambridge,
and found peculiar pleasure in the minutest circumstances
we could recollect about you all.</p></div>

<p>At Cawnpore, in front of his house, he began his
wonderful preaching to the native beggars and ascetics of all
kinds, Hindoo <i>jogees</i> and Mohammedan <i>fakeers</i>, the blind
and the deaf, the maimed and the halt, the diseased and
the dying, the impostor and the truly needy. These classes
had soon found out the sympathetic padre-sahib, and to
secure peace he seems to have organised a weekly dole of
an anna each or of rice.</p>

<p>He wrote to Corrie:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I feel unhappy, not because I do nothing, but because
I am not willing to do my duty. The flesh must be
mortified, and I am reluctant to take up the cross. Sabat
said to me yesterday, &lsquo;Your beggars are come: why do not
you preach to them? It is your duty.&rsquo; I made excuses;
but why do not I preach to them? My carnal spirit says
that I have been preaching a long time without success to
my servants, who are used to my tongue; what can I
expect from them&mdash;the very dregs of the people? But the
true cause is shame: I am afraid of exposing myself to
the contempt of Sabat, my servants, and the mob, by
attempting to speak in a language which I do not speak
well. To-day in prayer, one consideration has been made
of some power in overcoming this shameful backwardness:&mdash;these
people, if I neglect to speak to them, will
give me a look at the last day which may fill me with
horror. Alas! brother, where is my zeal?</p>

<p><i>December 17.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached to H.M. Light
Dragoons on Rev. iii. 20:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> &lsquo;Behold, I stand at the door and
knock,&rsquo; etc. There was great attention. In the afternoon
the beggars came, to the number of above four hundred,
and, by the help of God, I determined to preach to them,
though I felt as if I were leading to execution. I stood
upon the <i>chabootra</i> in front of which they were collected.</p></div>

<p>To Corrie he thus described his talks with his &lsquo;congregation
of the poor&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I went without fear, trusting to myself, and not to the
Lord, and accordingly I was put to shame&mdash;that is, I did
not read half as well as the preceding days. I shuffled
and stammered, and indeed I am persuaded that there
were many sentences the poor things did not understand
at all. I spoke of the dry land, rivers, etc.; here I
mentioned Gunga,&lsquo;a good river,&rsquo; but there were others as
good. God loves Hindus, but does He not love others
also? He gave them a good river, but to others as good.
All are alike before God. This was received with applause.
On the work of the fourth day, &lsquo;Thus sun and moon are
lamps. Shall I worship a candle in my hand? As a
candle in the house, so is the sun in the sky.&rsquo; Applause
from the Mohammedans. There were also hisses, but
whether these betokened displeasure against me or the
worship of the sun I do not know. I then charged them
to worship Gunga and sun and moon no more, but the
honour they used to give to them, henceforward to give to
God their Maker. Who knows but even this was a blow
struck, at least a branch lopped from the tree of heathenism?
The number was about 550. You need not be deterred,
dear brother, if this simple way of teaching do any good.</p></div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I spoke on the corruption of human nature, &lsquo;The Lord
saw that every imagination,&rsquo; etc. In the application I
said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> &lsquo;Hence all outward works are useless while the heart
remains in this state. You may wash in Gunga, but the
heart is not washed.&rsquo; Some old men shook their heads, in
much the same way as we do when seriously affected with
any truth. The number was about seven hundred. The
servants told me it was nonsense to give them all rice, as
they were not all poor; hundreds of them are working
people; among them was a whole row of Brahmins. I
spoke to them about the Flood; this was interesting, as
they were very attentive, and at the end said, &lsquo;Shabash
wa wa&rsquo; (Well said).</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood pictures the scene after an almost
pathetic fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We went often on the Sunday evenings to hear the
addresses of Mr. Martyn to the assembly of mendicants,
and we generally stood behind him. On these occasions
we had to make our way through a dense crowd, with a
temperature often rising above 92°, whilst the sun poured
its burning rays upon us through a lurid haze of dust.
Frightful were the objects which usually met our eyes in
this crowd: so many monstrous and diseased limbs, and
hideous faces, were displayed before us, and pushed forward
for our inspection, that I have often made my way to the
<i>chabootra</i> with my eyes shut, whilst Mr. Sherwood led
me. On reaching the platform I was surrounded by our
own people, and yet even there I scarcely dared to look
about me. I still imagine that I hear the calm, distinct,
and musical tones of Henry Martyn, as he stood raised
above the people, endeavouring, by showing the purity of
the Divine law, to convince the unbelievers that by their
works they were all condemned; and that this was the
case of every man of the offspring of Adam, and they
therefore needed a Saviour who was both willing and able
to redeem them. From time to time low murmurs and
curses would arise in the distance, and then roll forward,
till they became so loud as to drown the voice of this pious
one, generally concluding with hissings and fierce cries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
But when the storm passed away, again might he be heard
going on where he had left off, in the same calm, steadfast
tone, as if he were incapable of irritation from the interruption.
Mr. Martyn himself assisted in giving each person
his <i>pice</i> (copper) after the address was concluded; and when
he withdrew to his bungalow I have seen him drop, almost
fainting, on a sofa, for he had, as he often said, even at
that time, a slow inflammation burning in his chest, and one
which he knew must eventually terminate his existence.
In consequence of this he was usually in much pain after
any exertion of speaking.</p>

<p>No dreams nor visions excited in the delirium of a
raging fever can surpass these realities. These devotees
vary in age and appearance: they are young and old, male
and female, bloated and wizened, tall and short, athletic
and feeble; some clothed with abominable rags; some
nearly without clothes; some plastered with mud and cow-dung;
others with matted, uncombed locks streaming
down to their heels; others with heads bald or scabby,
every countenance being hard and fixed, as it were, by the
continual indulgence of bad passions, the features having
become exaggerated, and the lips blackened with tobacco,
or blood-red with the juice of the henna. But these and
such as these form only the general mass of the people;
there are among them still more distinguished monsters.
One little man generally comes in a small cart drawn by a
bullock; his body and limbs are so shrivelled as to give,
with his black skin and large head, the appearance of a
gigantic frog. Another has his arm fixed above his head,
the nail of the thumb piercing through the palm of the
hand; another, and a very large man, has his ribs and the
bones of his face externally traced with white chalk, which,
striking the eye in relief above the dark skin, makes him
appear, as he approaches, like a moving skeleton. When
Mr. Martyn collected these people he was most carefully
watched by the British authorities.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Shall anyone say that the missionary chaplain&rsquo;s eighteen
months&rsquo; work among this mixed multitude of the poor
and the dishonest was as vain as he himself, in his humility,
feared that it was? &lsquo;Greater works&rsquo; than His own were
what the Lord of Glory, who did like service to man in
the Syria of that day, promised to His believing followers.</p>

<p>On the wall which enclosed his compound was a kiosk,
from which some young Mussulman idlers used to look down
on the preacher, as they smoked their hookahs and sipped
their sherbet. One Sunday, determined to hear as well as see,
that they might the more evidently scoff, they made their
way through the crowd, and with the deepest scorn took
their place in the very front. They listened in a critical
temper, made remarks on what they heard, and returned
to the kiosk. But there was one who no longer joined in
their jeering. Sheikh Saleh, born at Delhi, Persian and
Arabic moonshi of Lucknow, then keeper of the King of
Oudh&rsquo;s jewels, was a Mussulman so zealous that he had
persuaded his Hindu servant to be circumcised. But he
was afterwards horrified by the treachery and the atrocities
of his co-religionists in the Rajpoot State of Joudhpore,
whither he had gone. He was on his way back to his
father at Lucknow when, on a heart thus prepared, there
fell the teaching of the English man of God as to the
purity of the Divine law and salvation from sin by Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>Eager to learn more of Christianity from its authoritative
records, he sought employment on the translating
staff of the preacher, through a friend who knew
Sabat. He was engaged to copy Persian manuscripts by
that not too scrupulous tyrant, without the knowledge
of Martyn or any of the English. On receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
completed Persian New Testament, to have it bound, he read
it all, and his conversion by the Spirit of God, its Author,
was complete. He determined to attach himself to Martyn,
who as yet knew him not personally. He followed him to
Calcutta, and applied to him for baptism. After due trial
during the next year he was admitted to the Church under
the new name of &lsquo;Bondman of Christ,&rsquo; Abdool Massee&rsquo;h.
This was almost the last act of the Rev. David Brown, who
since 1775 had spent his life in diffusing Christian knowledge
in Bengal. Abdool&rsquo;s conversion caused great excitement in
Lucknow. Nor was this all. The new convert was sent
to Meerut, when Mr. Parson was chaplain in that great
military station, and there he won over the chief physician
of the Rajah of Bhurtpore, naming him Taleb Massee&rsquo;h.
After preaching and disputing in Meerut, Abdool visited
the Begum Sumroo&rsquo;s principality of Sardhana, where he
left Taleb to care for the native Christians. They and
the Sherwoods together were the means of calling and
preparing several native converts for baptism, all the fruit,
direct and indirect, of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s combined translating
and preaching of the New Testament at Cawnpore.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We were told that Mr. Corrie might perhaps be unable
to come as far as Delhi, and the candidates for baptism
became so anxious that they set off to meet him on the
Delhi road. We soon heard of their meeting from Mr.
Corrie himself, and that he was pleased with them. Shortly
afterwards our beloved friend appeared, with tents, camels,
and elephants, and we had the pleasure of having his
largest tent pitched in our compound, for we had not room
for all his suite within the house. Then for the next week
our house and grounds brought to my mind what I had
often fancied of a scene in some high festival in Jerusalem;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
but ours was an assembly under a fairer, brighter dispensation.
&lsquo;Here we are,&rsquo; said Mr. Corrie, &lsquo;poor weary pilgrims;&rsquo;
and he applied the names of &lsquo;Christian&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mercy&rsquo; to his
wife and an orphan girl who was with them. Dear Mr.
Corrie! perhaps there never was a man so universally
beloved as he was. Wherever he was known, from the
lisping babe who climbed upon his knee to the hoary-headed
native, he was regarded as a bright example of
Christian charity and humility. On Sunday, January 31,
the baptism of all the converts but one took place. Numbers
of Europeans from different quarters of the station
attended. The little chapel was crowded to overflowing,
and most affecting indeed was the sight. Few persons
could restrain their tears when Mr. Corrie extended his
hand to raise the silver curls which clustered upon the brow
of Monghul Das, one of the most sincere of the converts.
The ceremony was very affecting, and the convert, who
stood by and saw the others baptized, became so uneasy
that, when Mr. Corrie set off to return, he followed him.
For family reasons this man&rsquo;s baptism had been deferred,
as he hoped by so doing to bring others of his family into
the Church of God.</p>

<p>How delightfully passed that Sunday!&mdash;how sweet was
our private intercourse with Mr. Corrie! He brought our
children many Hindustani hymns, set to ancient Oriental
melodies, which they were to sing at the Hindu services,
and we all together sang a hymn, which I find in my Journal
designated by this title:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">We Have Seen His Star in The East</span>&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">In Britain&rsquo;s land of light my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i8">To Jesus and His love was blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Till, wandering midst the heathen far,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Lo in the East I saw His star.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Oh, should my steps, which distant roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Attain once more my native shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Better than India&rsquo;s wealth by far,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">I&rsquo;ll speak the worth of Bethlehem&rsquo;s star.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>There is little merit in the composition of this hymn;
but it had a peculiar interest for us at that time, and the
sentiment which it professes must ever retain its interest.</p></div>

<p>Long after this the good seed of the Kingdom, as sown
by Henry Martyn, continued to bear fruit, which in its
turn propagated itself. In 1816 there came to Corrie in
Calcutta, for further instruction, from Bareilly, a young
Mohammedan ascetic and teacher who, at seventeen, had
abandoned Hinduism, seeking peace of mind. He fell
in with Martyn&rsquo;s Hindustani New Testament, and was
baptized under the new name of Fuez Massee&rsquo;h. Under
somewhat similar circumstances Noor Massee&rsquo;h was baptized
at Agra. The missionary labours of Martyn at
Cawnpore, followed up by Corrie there and at Agra soon
after, farther resulted in the baptism there of seventy-one
Hindus and Mohammedans, of whom fifty were adults.
All of these, save seven, remained steadfast, and many
became missionaries in their turn. The career of Abdool
Massee&rsquo;h closed in 1827, after he had been ordained in
the Calcutta cathedral by Bishop Heber, who loved him.
His last breath was spent in singing the Persian hymn,
translated thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Beloved Saviour, let not me<br /></span>
<span class="i10">In Thy kind heart forgotten be!<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Of all that deck the field or bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Thou art the sweetest, fairest flower!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Youth&rsquo;s morn has fled, old age comes on.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">But sin distracts my soul alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Beloved Saviour, let not me<br /></span>
<span class="i10">In Thy kind heart forgotten be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As from Dinapore Martyn sought out the moulvies of
Patna, so from Cawnpore he found his way to Lucknow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
There, after he had baptized a child of the Governor-General&rsquo;s
Resident, he met the Nawab Saadut Ali, and
his eyes for the first time beheld one who had full power
of life and death over his subjects. He visited the
moulvies, at the tomb of Asaf-ood-Dowla, who were
employed to read the Koran constantly. &lsquo;With them I
tried my strength, of course, and disputed for an hour; it
ended in their referring me for an answer to another.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Toil such as Martyn&rsquo;s, physical and mental, in successive
hot seasons, in such hospitals and barracks as then killed
off the British troops and their families, and without a decent
church building, would have sacrificed the healthiest in a
few years. Corrie had to flee from it, or he would never
have lived to be the first and model Bishop of Madras. But
such labours, such incessant straining of the voice through
throat and lungs, acting on his highly neurotic constitution,
and the phthisical frame which he inherited from his
mother, became possible to Henry Martyn only because
he willed, he agonised, to live till he should give at least
the New Testament to the peoples of Arabia and Persia,
and to the Mohammedans of India, in their own tongues.
We see him in his <i>Journal</i>, before God, spiritually spurring
the sides of his intent day by day, and running like the
noble Arab horse till it drops&mdash;its object gained. He had
many warnings, and if he had had a wife to see that he
obeyed the voice of Providence he might have outlived his
hereditary tendency in such a tropical climate as that of
India&mdash;a fact since proved by experience. He had narrowly
escaped death at Dinapore a few months before, and he
knew it. But it is well that, far more frequently than the
world knows, such cases occur in the missionary fields of
the world. The Brainerds and the Martyns, the Pattesons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and the Hanningtons, the Keith-Falconers and the
Mackays&mdash;to mention some of the dead only&mdash;have their
reward in calling hundreds to fill their places, not less than
the Careys and the Livingstones, the Duffs and the
Wilsons, the Frenches and the Caldwells. To all who
know the tropics, and especially the seasons of India, the
dates that follow are eloquent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1809, May 29.</i>&mdash;The East has been long forsaken of God,
and depravity in consequence more thoroughly wrought
into them. I have been very ill all this week, the disorder
appearing in the form of an intermittent. In the night
cold sweats, and for about five hours in the day head-ache
and vertigo. Last night I took some medicine, and
think that I am better, though the time when the fever has
generally come on is not yet arrived. But I hardly know
how to be thankful enough for this interval of ease.</p>

<p><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;Set out at three in the morning for
Currah, and reached it on the 26th in the morning, and
married a Miss K. to Mr. R.; the company was very
unpleasant, so after passing the night there, I set out and
travelled all day and night, and through Divine mercy
arrived at home again on the 28th, but excessively fatigued,
indeed almost exhausted. At night with the men, my
whole desire was to lie low in the dust. &lsquo;Thou hast left
thy first love,&rsquo; on which I spoke, was an awful call to me,
and I trust in God I shall ever feel it so.</p>

<p><i>November 19.</i>&mdash;Received a letter from Mr. Simeon,
mentioning Sarah&rsquo;s illness; consumption has seized her, as
it did my mother and sister, and will carry her off as it did
them, and now I am the only one left. Oh, my dear Corrie,
though I know you are well prepared, how does nature
bleed at the thought of a beloved sister&rsquo;s drooping and
dying! Yet still to see those whom I love go before me,
without so much as a doubt of their going to glory, will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
I hope, soothe my sorrow. How soon shall I follow? I
know it must be soon. The paleness and fatigue I exhibit
after every season of preaching show plainly that death is
settled in my lungs.</p>

<p><i>1810, April 9.</i>&mdash;From the labours of yesterday, added
to constant conversation and disagreement with visitors
to-day, I was quite exhausted, and my chest in pain.</p>

<p><i>April 10.</i>&mdash;My lungs still so disordered that I could
not meet my men at night.</p>

<p><i>April 15.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached to the Dragoons on the
parable of the pounds. At the General&rsquo;s on Luke xxii 22.
With the native congregation I strained myself greatly
in order to be heard, and to this I attribute the injury I
did myself to-day. Attempted the usual service with my
men at night, but after speaking to them from a passage in
Scripture, was obliged to leave them before prayer.</p>

<p><i>April 16.</i>&mdash;Imprudently joined in conversation with
some dear Christian friends to-night, and talked a great
deal; the pain in the chest in consequence returned.</p>

<p><i>May 12.</i>&mdash;This evening thrown with great violence
from my horse: while he was in full gallop, the saddle
came off, but I received no other injury but contusion.
Thus a gracious Providence preserves me in life. But
for His kindness I had been now dragging out a wretched
existence in pain, and my blessed work interrupted for
years perhaps.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn was too absorbed in the higher life at
all times to be trusted in riding or driving. Mrs. Sherwood
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I often went out with him in his gig, when he used to
call either for me or Miss Corrie, and whoever went with
him went at the peril of their lives. He never looked
where he was driving, but went dashing through thick and
thin, being always occupied in reading Hindustani by word
of mouth, or discussing some text of Scripture. I certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
never expected to have survived a lesson he gave me in
his gig, in the midst of the plain at Cawnpore, on the
pronunciation of one of the Persian letters.</p></div>

<p>All through his Cawnpore life, also, the wail of disappointed
love breaks from time to time. On Christmas
day, 1809, he received, through David Brown as usual, a
letter &lsquo;from Lydia, containing a second refusal; so now I
have done.&rsquo; On March 23, 1810, Mr. Steven&rsquo;s letter reached
him, reporting the death of his last sister. &lsquo;She was my
dear counsellor and guide for a long time in the Christian
way. I have not a relation left to whom I feel bound by
ties of Christian fellowship, and I am resolved to form no
new connection of a worldly nature, so that I may henceforward
hope to live entirely, as a man of another world.&rsquo;
Meanwhile he has received Lydia Grenfell&rsquo;s sisterly offer,
to which he thus replies in the first of eleven letters, to one
who had sunk the lover in the Christian friend, as was
possible to two hearts so far separated and never to meet
again in this world. But she was still his &lsquo;dearest.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Lydia Grenfell</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
Cawnpore: March 30, 1810.
</p>

<p>Since you kindly bid me, my beloved friend, consider
you in the place of that dear sister whom it has pleased
God in His wisdom to take from me, I gratefully accept
the offer of a correspondence, which it has ever been the
anxious wish of my heart to establish. Your kindness is
the more acceptable, because it is shown in the day of
affliction. Though I had heard of my dearest sister&rsquo;s
illness some months before I received the account of her
death, and though the nature of her disorder was such as
left me not a ray of hope, so that I was mercifully prepared
for the event, still the certainty of it fills me with
anguish. It is not that she has left me, for I never ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>pected
to see her more on earth. I have no doubt of
meeting her in heaven, but I cannot bear to think of the
pangs of dissolution she underwent, which have been
unfortunately detailed to me with too much particularity.
Would that I had never heard them, or could efface them
from my remembrance. But oh, may I learn what the Lord
is teaching me by these repeated strokes! May I learn
meekness and resignation. May the world always appear
as vain as it does now, and my own continuance in it as
short and uncertain. How frightful is the desolation which
Death makes, and how appalling his visits when he enters
one&rsquo;s family. I would rather never have been born than be
born and die, were it not for Jesus, the Prince of life, the
Resurrection and the Life. How inexpressibly precious is
this Saviour when eternity seems near! I hope often to
communicate with you on these subjects, and in return for
your kind and consolatory letters to send you, from time
to time, accounts of myself and my proceedings. Through
you I can hear of all my friends in the West. When I
first heard of the loss I was likely to suffer, and began to
reflect on my own friendless situation, you were much in
my thoughts, whether you would be silent on this occasion
or no? whether you would persist in your resolution?
Friends indeed I have, and brethren, blessed be God! but
two brothers<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> cannot supply the place of one sister. When
month after month passed away, and no letter came from
you, I almost abandoned the hope of ever hearing from
you again. It only remained to wait the result of my last
application through Emma. You have kindly anticipated
my request, and, I need scarcely add, are more endeared to
me than ever.</p>

<p>Of your illness, my dearest Lydia, I had heard nothing,
and it was well for me that I did not.&mdash;Yours most
affectionately,</p>

<p>To David Brown he wrote, &lsquo;My long-lost Lydia consents

addresses to Lydia herself again a letter of exquisite
tenderness:</p>

</p>

<p>I begin my correspondence with my beloved Lydia,
not without a fear of its being soon to end. Shall I venture
to tell you that our family complaint has again made its
appearance in me, with more unpleasant symptoms than it
has ever yet done? However, God, who two years ago
redeemed my life from destruction, may again, for His
Church&rsquo;s sake, interpose for my deliverance. Though, alas!
what am I that my place should not instantly be supplied
with far more efficient instruments? The symptoms I
mentioned are chiefly a pain in the chest, occasioned, I
suppose, by over-exertion the two last Sundays, and incapacitating
me at present from all public duty, and even
from conversation. You were mistaken in supposing that
my former illness originated from study. Study never
makes me ill&mdash;scarcely ever fatigues me&mdash;but my lungs!
death is seated there; it is speaking that kills me. May
it give others life! &lsquo;Death worketh in us, but life in you.&rsquo;
Nature intended me, as I should judge from the structure
of my frame, for chamber-council, not for a pleader at the
Bar. But the call of Jesus Christ bids me cry aloud and
spare not. As His minister, I am a debtor both to the
Greek and the barbarian. How can I be silent when I
have both ever before me, and my debt not paid? You
would suggest that energies more restrained will eventually
be more efficient. I am aware of this, and mean to act
upon this principle in future, if the resolution is not formed
too late. But you know how apt we are to outstep the
bounds of prudence when there is no kind of monitor at
hand to warn us of the consequences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Had I been favoured with the one I wanted, I might
not now have had occasion to mourn. You smile at my
allusion, at least I hope so, for I am hardly in earnest. I
have long since ceased to repine at the decree that keeps
us as far asunder as the east is from the west, and yet am
far from regretting that I ever knew you. The remembrance
of you calls forth the exercise of delightful
affections, and has kept me from many a snare. How wise
and good is our God in all His dealings with His children!
Had I yielded to the suggestions of flesh and blood, and
remained in England, as I should have done, without the
effectual working of His power, I should without doubt
have sunk with my sisters into an early grave. Whereas
here, to say the least, I may live a few years, so as to
accomplish a very important work. His keeping you from
me appears also, at this season of bodily infirmity, to be
occasion of thankfulness. Death, I think, would be a less
welcome visitor to me, if he came to take me from a wife,
and that wife were you. Now, if I die, I die unnoticed,
involving none in calamity. Oh, that I could trust Him for
all that is to come, and love Him with that perfect love
which casteth out fear; for, to say the truth, my confidence
is sometimes shaken. To appear before the Judge of quick
and dead is a much more awful thought in sickness than in
health. Yet I dare not doubt the all-sufficiency of Jesus
Christ, nor can I, with the utmost ingenuity of unbelief,
resist the reasonings of St. Paul, all whose reasons seem to
be drawn up on purpose to work into the mind the
persuasion that God will glorify Himself by the salvation
of sinners through Jesus Christ. I wish I could more
enter into the meaning of this &lsquo;chosen vessel.&rsquo; He seems
to move in a world by himself, and sometimes to utter the
unspeakable words such as my natural understanding
discerneth not; and when I turn to commentators I find
that I have passed out of the spiritual to the material
world, and have got amongst men like myself. But soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
as he says, we shall no longer see as in a glass, by
reflected rays, but see as we are seen, and know as we are
known.</p>

<p><i>April 25.</i>&mdash;After another interval I resume my pen.
Through the mercy of God I am again quite well, but my
mind is a good deal distressed at Sabat&rsquo;s conduct. I forbear
writing what I think, in the hope that my fears may prove
groundless; but indeed the children of the East are adepts
in deceit. Their duplicity appears to me so disgusting at
this moment, that I can only find relief from my growing
misanthropy by remembering Him who is the faithful and
true Witness; in whom all the promises of God are &lsquo;yea
and amen&rsquo;; and by turning to the faithful in Europe&mdash;children
that will not lie. Where shall we find sincerity
in a native of the East? Yesterday I dined in a private
way with <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>. After one year&rsquo;s inspection of me they
begin to lose their dread and venture to invite me. Our
conversation was occasionally religious, but topics of this
nature are so new to fashionable people, and those upon
which they have thought so much less than on any other,
that often from the shame of having nothing to say they
pass to other subjects where they can be more at home. I
was asked after dinner if I liked music. On my professing to
be an admirer of harmony, cantos were performed and songs
sung. After a time I inquired if they had no sacred music.
It was now recollected that they had some of Handel&rsquo;s, but it
could not be found. A promise, however, was made that
next time I came it should be produced. Instead of it the
145th Psalm-tune was played, but none of the ladies could
recollect enough of the tune to sing it. I observed that all
our talents and powers should be consecrated to the service
of Him who gave them. To this no reply was made, but
the reproof was felt. I asked the lady of the house if she
read poetry, and then proceeded to mention Cowper, whose
poems, it seems, were in the library; but the lady had
never heard of the book. This was produced, and I read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
some passages. Poor people! here a little and there a
little is a rule to be observed in speaking to them.</p>

<p><i>April 26.</i>&mdash;From speaking to my men last night, and
again to-day conversing long with some natives, my chest
is again in pain, so much so that I can hardly speak.
Well, now I am taught, and will take more care in future.
My sheet being full, I must bid you adieu. The Lord
ever bless and keep you. Believe me to be with the
truest affection,&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

</p>

<p>My dearest Brother,&mdash;I am again disappointed in
receiving no letter from you. The last intelligence from
the West of England is Lydia&rsquo;s letter of July 8, 1808.
Colonel Sandys has long since ceased to write to me, and I
have no other correspondent. It is very affecting to me to
be thus considered as dead by almost all my natural relations
and early connections; and at this time, when I am
led to think of you and the family to which you are united,
and have been reading all your letters over, I feel that I
could dip my pen deep in melancholy; for, strange as it
may seem to you, I love so true, that though it is now the
fifth year since I parted from the object of my affection, she
is as dear to me as ever; yet, on the other hand, I find my
present freedom such a privilege that I would not lose
it for hardly any consideration. It is the impossibility of
compassing every wish, that I suppose is the cause of any
uneasiness that I feel. I know not how to express my
thoughts respecting Lydia better than in Martial&rsquo;s words&mdash;<i>Nec
tecum possum vivere nec sine te</i>. However, these are
not my general sentiments; it pleases God to cause me to
eat my meat with gladness, praising God. Almost always
I am without carefulness, as indeed it would be to my shame
if I were not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>My kindest remembrances attend my dearest sisters,
Emma and Lydia, as they well know. You two are such
bad correspondents that on this ground I prefer another
petition for the renewal of Lydia&rsquo;s correspondence,&mdash;she
need not suspect anything now, nor her friends. I have
no idea that I should trouble her upon the old subject, even
if I were settled in England&mdash;for oh, this vain world! <i>quid
habet commodi? quid non potius laboris?</i></p>

<p>But I never expect to see England more, nor do I expect
that though all obstacles should be removed, she would
ever become mine unless I came for her, and I now do not
wonder at it, though I did before. If any one of my sisters
had had such a proposal made to them, I would never have
consented to their going, so you may see the affair is
ended between us. My wish is that she would be scribe
for you all, and I promise on my part to send you through
her an ample detail <i>of all my</i> proceedings; also she need
not imagine that I may form another attachment&mdash;in which
case she might suppose a correspondence with an unmarried
lady might be productive of difficulties,&mdash;for after
one disappointment I am not likely to try my chance
again, and if I do I will give her the earliest intelligence
of it, with the same frankness with which I have always
dealt (with her).</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the silent shores of South Cornwall,
Lydia Grenfell was thus remembering him before God:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1809, March 30.</i>&mdash;My dear friend in India much upon
my heart lately, chiefly in desires that the work of God
may prosper in his hands, and that he may become more
and more devoted to the Lord. I seem, as to the future,
to have attained what a year or two since I prayed much
for&mdash;to regard him absent as in another state of existence,
and my affection is holy, pure, and spiritual for this dear
saint of God; when it is otherwise, it is owing to my looking
back. Recollections sometimes intrude, and I welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
them, alas, and act over again the past&mdash;but Lord, Thy
holy, blessed will be done&mdash;cheerfully, thankfully I say
this.</p>

<p><i>Tregembo, July 11.</i>&mdash;I have suffered from levity of
spirit, and lost thereby the enjoyment of God. How good
then is it in the Lord to employ means in His providence
to recall His wanderer to Himself and happiness! Such
mercy belongeth unto God&mdash;and this His care over me I
will record as a testimony against myself, if I forsake Him
again and lose that sweet seriousness of mind, so essential
to my peace and safety. Though I have never (perhaps
for many hours in a day) ceased to remember my dear
friend in India, it has not of late been in a way but as I
might love and think of him in heaven. Why is it then
that the intelligence of his probable nearness to that
blessed abode should distress me? yet it did, and does so
still. It is this intelligence which has, I hope, taught that
my late excessive cheerfulness was dangerous to my soul,
in weakening my hold of better and calmer joys. I was
directed, I think, to the thirty-sixth Psalm for what I
wanted on this occasion, as I was once before to the sixty-first,
and I have found it most wonderfully cheering to my
heart. The Lord, as &lsquo;the preserver of man and beast,&rsquo;
caused me to exercise dependence on Him respecting the
result of my friend&rsquo;s illness. Then the description of the
Divine perfections drew back my wandering heart, I hope
to God. The declaration of those who trust in God being
abundantly satisfied with the fatness of His house, taught
me where real enjoyment alone will be found; but the
concluding part opened in a peculiarly sweet way to my
mind: &lsquo;Thou shalt make them drink of the river of Thy
pleasures.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>October 23.</i>&mdash;I am under some painful forebodings
respecting my dear absent friend, and know not how to
act. I am strongly impelled to write to him, now that he
is in affliction and perhaps sickness himself&mdash;yet I dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
departing from the plain path of duty. &lsquo;O Lord, direct
me,&rsquo; is my cry. I hope my desire is to do Thy will, and
only Thy will. I have given him up to Thee&mdash;oh, let me
do so sincerely, and trust in Thy fatherly care.</p>

<p><i>1810, January 1.</i>&mdash;Felt the necessity of beginning this
year with prayer for preserving grace. Prayed with some
sense of my own weakness and dependence on God&mdash;with
a conviction of much sin and hope in His mercy through
Jesus Christ. Oh, to be Thine, Lord, in heart and life this
year! Had a remembrance of those most dear to me in
prayer, and found it very sweet to commend them to God,
especially my friend in India&mdash;perhaps not now in India,
but in heaven. Oh, to join him at last in Thy blissful
presence!</p>

<p><i>January 24.</i>&mdash;Heard yesterday of the marriage of Mr.
John&mdash;what a mercy to me do I feel it!&mdash;a load gone off
my mind, for every evil I heard of his committing I feared
I might have been the cause of, by my conduct ten years
since&mdash;I rejoice in this event for his sake and my own.</p>

<p><i>February 6.</i>&mdash;Heard at last of the safety of my friend
in India, and wrote to him&mdash;many fears on my mind as to
its propriety, and great deadness of soul in doing it&mdash;yet
ere I concluded I felt comforted from the thought of the
nearness of eternity, and the certainty that then, without
any fear of doing wrong, I should again enjoy communion
with him.</p>

<p><i>February 24.</i>&mdash;Many sad presages of evil concerning
my absent friend, yet I am enabled to leave all to God&mdash;only
now I pray, if consistent with His will, his life may
be spared, and as a means of it, that God may incline him
to return again to this land. I never did before dare to
ask this, believing the cause of God would be more advanced
by his remaining in India; but now I pray, without fear of
doing wrong or opposing the will of God, for his return.</p>

<p><i>March 5.</i>&mdash;I am sensible of a very remarkable change
in the desires of my soul before God, respecting my absent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
friend. I with freedom and peace now pray continually
that he may be restored to his friends and country; before,
I never dared to ask anything but that the Lord would
order this as His wisdom saw fit, and thought it not a
subject for prayer. His injured health causes me to believe
that India is not the place for his labours&mdash;and, oh, that his
mind may be rightly influenced and the Lord&rsquo;s will done,
whether it be his remaining there or returning.</p>

<p><i>April 23.</i>&mdash;Wrote to India.</p>

<p><i>November 30.</i>&mdash;Heard yesterday, and again to-day,
from India.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The illness of my friend fills me with apprehensions
on his account, and I seemed called on to prepare
for hearing of his removal. I wish to place before my
eyes the blessedness of the change to him, and, though
agitated and sad, I can bear to think of our never more
beholding each other in this world. This indeed has long
been my expectation, and that he should have left the
toils of mortality for the joys of heaven should, on his
account, fill me with praise&mdash;yet my heart cannot rise
with thankfulness. I seem stupefied, insensible to any
feeling but that of anxiety to hear again and know the
truth, and that my heart could joy in God at all times;
but alas! all is cold there! Oh, return, blessed Spirit of life
and peace.</p>

<p><i>1811, March 28.</i>&mdash;Heard from my dearest friend in
India.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Rose early. Found my spirit engaged in prayer,
but was far ... otherwise in reading. Such dulness
and inattention as ought deeply to abase me, vanity and a
desire to appear of importance in the school, beset me.</p></div>

<p>Corrie had been ordered from his narrow parish of
Chunar to the wider field of Agra, and on his way up was
directed to remain at Cawnpore to help his friend, whose
physical exhaustion was too apparent even to the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
careless officer. Among those influenced by both was
one of the surgeons, Dr. Govan,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> who was spared, at St.
Andrews, till after the Mutiny of 1857, when in an unpublished
lecture to its Literary and Philosophical Society,
he thus alluded to these workers in Cawnpore:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Hukeem and the missionary hear native opinion
spoken out with much greater freedom than the political
agent, the judge, or commandant. &lsquo;Were there many
more of the <i>Sahibean Ungez</i> (the English gentlemen) in
character like the Padre Sahibs (Corrie and Martyn),
Christianity would make more progress here,&rsquo; was the unvaried
testimony of the natives in their favour.... I
cannot help mentioning the results of various conversations
I had with two natives of Eastern rank and family employed
by the Venerable Mr. Corrie, afterwards Bishop of Madras,
and the Rev. Henry Martyn, in Scripture translation, and
whose assistance I had used in the study of the languages,
as they quite coincide with much which I had the opportunity
of hearing among men of still higher position in the
native educated community, when attached to the staff of
the Governor-General: &lsquo;By the decrees of God,&rsquo; said the
Mohammedan noble, &lsquo;and the ubiquity of their fleets,
armaments, and commerce, it appears plainly that the
European nations have become the arbiters of the destinies
of the nations of Asia. Yet this seems to us strange in
the followers of Him who taught that His true disciples
must be ready to give their cloaks also to him who took
from them their coats.&rsquo; To which I had no better reply
than this, that the progress of events in the world&rsquo;s history
seems to us to give evidence that undoubtedly a Divine
message had been sent, both to governments and their
subjects, to which, at their peril, both must give attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
But that, as a question of public national policy, it seemed
generally admitted and understood that the civil rulers of
no nation, Christian, Mohammedan, or Heathen, were laid
under an obligation, by their individual beliefs, to allow a
country, unable to govern itself by reason of its interminable
divisions and subjects of deadly internal strife, to be
occupied and made use of by their European or other
enemies, as a means for their own injury or destruction, for
any criminal or sinful acts, done in the building up of a
nation or government. I may add that I never heard a
native of India attempt directly to impugn the perfect
justice of the British possession of India on this ground.
&lsquo;The Padre Sahib has put the subject in its true light&rsquo;
(said the same Mohammedan authority) &lsquo;when he said
that Christianity had higher objects in view, in its influence
on human character, than to enforce absolute rules about
meats and drinks; for should he even induce me (which is
unlikely) to become more of a Christian than I am, believing,
as I do, in the authority of the Old Testament prophets,
and in Jesus Christ as a prophet sent by God, he will
never persuade me to look upon many articles of diet used
by Christians with anything but the most intense disgust
and abhorrence, and he will assuredly find it the same with
most of these idolatrous Hindus.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>We return to Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i> and <i>Correspondence</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>July 8.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Corrie preached to the 53rd a
funeral sermon on the death of one of their captains. In
the afternoon I spoke to the natives on the first commandment,
with greater fluency than I have yet found. My
thoughts to-day very much towards Lydia; I began even
to be reconciled to the idea of going to England for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>

of the Lord, that shall stand.&rsquo;</p>

</p>

<p>With what delight do I sit down to begin a letter
to my beloved Lydia! Yours of February 5, which I
received a few days ago, was written, I conceive, in considerable
embarrassment. You thought it possible it might
find me married, or about to be so. Let me begin,
therefore, with assuring you, with more truth than Gehazi
did his master, &lsquo;Thy servant went no whither:&rsquo; my heart
has not strayed from Marazion, or Gurlyn, or wherever you
are. Five long years have passed, and I am still faithful.
Happy would it be if I could say that I had been equally
true to my profession of love for Him who is fairer than ten
thousand, and altogether lovely. Yet to the praise of His
grace let me recollect that twice five years have passed away
since I began to know Him, and I am still not gone from
Him. On the contrary, time and experience have endeared
the Lord to me more and more, so that I feel less
inclination, and see less reason for leaving Him. What is
there, alas! in the world, were it even everlasting?</p>

<p>I rejoice at the accounts you give me of your continued
good health and labours of love. Though you are not so
usefully employed as you might be in India, yet as that
must not be, I contemplate with delight your exertions at
the other end of the world. May you be instrumental in
bringing many sons and daughters to glory. What is
become of St. Hilary and its fairy scenes? When I think
of Malachy, and the old man, and your sister, and Josepha,
etc., how some are dead, and the rest dispersed, and their
place occupied by strangers, it seems all like a dream.</p>

<p><i>August 15.</i>&mdash;It is only little intervals of time that I can
find for writing; my visitors, about whom I shall write
presently, taking up much of my leisure from necessary duty.
Here follow some extracts from my <i>Journal</i>....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Here my <i>Journal</i> must close. I do not know whether
you understand from it how we go on. I must endeavour
to give you a clearer idea of it.</p>

<p>We all live here in bungalows, or thatched houses, on a
piece of ground enclosed. Next to mine is the church, not
yet opened for public worship, but which we make use of
at night with the men of the 53rd. Corrie lives with me,
and Miss Corrie with the Sherwoods. We usually rise
at daybreak, and breakfast at six. Immediately after
breakfast we pray together, after which I translate into
Arabic with Sabat, who lives in a small bungalow on my
ground. We dine at twelve, and sit recreating ourselves
with talking a little about dear friends in England. In the
afternoon, I translate with Mirza Fitrut into Hindustani,
and Corrie employs himself in teaching some native
Christian boys whom he is educating with great care, in
hopes of their being fit for the office of catechist. I have
also a school on my premises, for natives; but it is not
well attended. There are not above sixteen Hindu boys
in it at present: half of them read the Book of Genesis.
At sunset we ride or drive, and then meet at the church,
where we often raise the song of praise, with as much joy,
through the grace and presence of our Lord, as you do in
England. At ten we are all asleep. Thus we go on. To the
hardships of missionaries we are strangers, yet not averse,
I trust, to encounter them when we are called. My work
at present is evidently to translate; hereafter I may
itinerate. Dear Corrie, I fear, never will, he always suffers
from moving about in the daytime. But I should have
said something about my health, as I find my death was
reported at Cambridge. I thank God I am perfectly well,
though not very strong in my lungs; they do not seem
affected yet, but I cannot speak long without uneasiness.
From the nature of my complaint, if it deserves the name,
it is evident that England is the last place I should go to.
I should go home only to find a grave. How shall I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
therefore ever see you more on this side of eternity?
Well! be it so, since such is the will of God: we shall
meet, through grace, in the realms of bliss.</p>

<p>I am truly sorry to see my paper fail. Write as often as
possible, every three months at least. Tell me where you
go, and whom you see and what you read.</p>

<p><i>August 17.</i>&mdash;I am sorry to conclude with saying that
my yesterday&rsquo;s boasted health proved a mistake; I was
seized with violent sickness in the night, but to-day am
better. Continue to pray for me, and believe me to be,
your ever affectionate,</p>

<p class="sig">

</p>
<hr class="shorthr" />
<p><i>September 22.</i>&mdash;Was walking with Lydia; both much
affected, and speaking on the things dearest to us both.
I awoke, and behold it was a dream. My mind remained
very solemn and pensive; shed some tears; the clock
struck three, and the moon was riding near her highest
noon; all was silence and solemnity, and I thought with
some pain of the sixteen thousand miles between us. But
good is the will of the Lord, if I see her no more.</p>

<p class="greeting">

</p>
<p class="date">
From the Ganges: October 6, 1810.<br />
</p>

<p>My dearest Lydia,&mdash;Though I have had no letter
from you very lately, nor have anything particular to say,
yet having been days on the water without a person to
speak to, tired also with reading and thinking, I mean to
indulge myself with a little of what is always agreeable to
me, and sometimes good for me; for as my affection for
you has something sacred in it, being founded on, or at
least cemented by, an union of spirit in the Lord Jesus; so
my separation also from you produced a deadness to the
world, at least for a time, which leaves a solemn impression
as often as I think of it. Add to this, that as I must not
indulge the hope of ever seeing you again in this world, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
cannot think of you without thinking also of that world
where we shall meet. You mention in one of your letters
my coming to England, as that which may eventually
prove a duty. You ought to have added, that in case I do
come, you will consider it a duty not to let me come away
again without you. But I am not likely to put you to the
trial. Useless as I am here, I often think I should be still
more so at home. Though my voice fails me, I can
translate and converse. At home I should be nothing
without being able to lift my voice on high. I have just
left my station, Cawnpore, in order to be silent six months.
I have no cough, or any kind of consumption, except that
reading prayers, or preaching, or a slight cold, brings on
pain in the chest. I am advised therefore to recruit my
strength by rest. So I am come forth, with my face
towards Calcutta, with an ulterior view to the sea. Nothing
happened at Cawnpore, after I wrote to you in September
but I must look to my <i>Journal</i>.</p>

<p>I think of having my portrait taken in Calcutta, as
I promised Mr. Simeon five years ago. Sabat&rsquo;s picture
would also be a curiosity. Yesterday I carried Col. Wood
to dine with me, at the Nabob Bahir Ali&rsquo;s. Sabat was
there. The Colonel, who had been reading by the way
the account of his conversion, in the Asiatic and East
Society Report, which I had given him, eyed him with no
great complacency, and observed in French, that Sabat
might not understand him, &lsquo;Il a l&rsquo;air d&rsquo;un sauvage.&rsquo; Sabat&rsquo;s
countenance is indeed terrible; noble when he is pleased,
but with the look of an assassin when he is out of humour.
I have had more opportunities of knowing Sabat than any
man has had, and I cannot regard him with that interest
which the &lsquo;Star in the East&rsquo; is calculated to excite in most
people. Buchanan says, I wrote (to whom I do not know)
in terms of admiration and affection about him. Affection
I do feel for him, but admiration, if I did once feel it, I am
not conscious of it at present. I tremble for everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
our dear friends publish about our doings in India, lest
shame come to us and them.</p>

<p><i>Calcutta, November 5.</i>&mdash;A sheet full, like the preceding,
I had written, but the moment it is necessary to send off
my letter I cannot find it. That it does not go on to you
is of little consequence, but into whose hands may it have
fallen? It is this that grieves me. It was the continuance
of my <i>Journal</i> to Calcutta, where I arrived the last day in
October. Constant conversation with dear friends here
has brought on the pain in the chest again, so that I do not
attempt to preach. In two or three weeks I shall embark
for the Gulf of Persia, where, if I live, I shall solace myself
in my hours of solitude with writing to you.</p>

<p>Farewell, beloved friend; pray for me, as you do, I am
sure, and doubt not of an unceasing interest in the heart
and prayers of your ever affectionate,</p>

<span class="smcap">H. Martyn.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Ordered away on six months&rsquo; sick leave, Henry Martyn
had the joy of once at least ministering to his soldier
flock in the &lsquo;new church,&rsquo; which he had induced the authorities
to form out of an ordinary bungalow. Daily and
fondly had he watched the preparations, reporting to
Brown: &lsquo;My church is almost ready for the organ and the
bell.&rsquo; On Sunday, September 16, he had written:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;Rain prevented me from having any service in public;
the natives not being able to sit upon the grass, I could not
preach to them.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>On Sunday, September 30, he thus took farewell of his
different congregations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Corrie preached to the Dragoons, at nine the new
church was opened. There was a considerable congregation,
and I preached on, &lsquo;In all places where I record my name,
I will come unto thee and bless thee.&rsquo; I felt something of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
thankfulness and joy, and our dear friends the same. The
Sherwoods and Miss Corrie stayed with us the rest of the
day. In the afternoon I preached the Gospel to the
natives for the first time, giving them a short account of
the life, death, miracles, manner of teaching, death and
resurrection of Jesus, then the doctrines of His religion, and
concluded with exhorting them to believe in Him, and
taking them to record that I had declared to them the glad
tidings that had come to us, and that if they rejected it I
was clear from their blood, and thus I bid them farewell.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood thus describes the scene:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the Sunday before Mr. Martyn left the church was
opened, and the bell sounded for the first time over this
land of darkness. The church was crowded, and there was
the band of our regiment to lead the singing and the
chanting. Sergeant Clarke&mdash;our Sergeant Clarke&mdash;had
been appointed as clerk; and there he sat under the desk
in due form, in his red coat, and went through his duty
with all due correctness. The Rev. Daniel Corrie read
prayers, and Mr. Martyn preached. That was a day never
to be forgotten. Those only who have been for some years
in a place where there never has been public worship can
have any idea of the fearful effect of its absence, especially
among the mass of the people, who, of course, are unregenerate.
Every prescribed form of public worship certainly
has a tendency to become nothing more than a form, yet
even a form may awaken reflection, and any state is better
than that of perfect deadness. From his first arrival at the
station Mr. Martyn had been labouring to effect the purpose
which he then saw completed; namely, the opening
of a place of worship. He was permitted to see it, to address
the congregation once, and then he was summoned
to depart. How often, how very often, are human beings
called away, perhaps from this world, at the moment they
have been enabled to bring to bear some favourite object.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Blessed are those whose object has been such a one as that
of Henry Martyn. Alas! he was known to be, even then,
in a most dangerous state of health, either burnt within by
slow inflammation, which gave a flush to his cheek, or pale
as death from weakness and lassitude.</p>

<p>On this occasion the bright glow prevailed&mdash;a brilliant
light shone from his eyes&mdash;he was filled with hope and joy;
he saw the dawn of better things, he thought, at Cawnpore,
and most eloquent, earnest, and affectionate was his address
to the congregation. Our usual party accompanied him
back to his bungalow, where, being arrived, he sank, as was
often his way, nearly fainting, on a sofa in the hall. Soon,
however, he revived a little, and called us all about him to
sing. It was then that we sang to him that sweet hymn
which thus begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">O God, our help in ages past,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Our hope for years to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Our shelter from the stormy blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And our eternal home.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We all dined early together, and then returned with our
little ones to enjoy some rest and quiet; but when the sun
began to descend to the horizon we again went over to
Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s bungalow, to hear his <i>last</i> address to the
<i>fakeers</i>. It was one of those sickly, hazy, burning evenings,
which I have before described, and the scene was
precisely such a one as I have recounted above. Mr.
Martyn nearly fainted again after this effort, and when he
got to his house, with his friends about him, he told us that
he was afraid he had not been the means of doing the
smallest good to any one of the strange people whom he
had thus so often addressed. He did not even then know
of the impression he had been enabled to make, on one of
these occasions, on Sheikh Saleh. On the Monday our
beloved friend went to his boats, which lay at the Ghaut,
nearest the bungalow; but in the cool of the evening, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>ever,
whilst Miss Corrie and myself were taking the air in
our tonjons, he came after us on horseback. There was a
gentle sadness in his aspect as he accompanied me home;
and Miss Corrie came also. Once again we all supped together,
and united in one last hymn. We were all low,
very, very low; we could never expect to behold again
that face which we then saw&mdash;to hear again that voice, or
to be again elevated and instructed by that conversation.
It was impossible to hope that he would survive the fatigue
of such a journey as he meditated. Often and often, when
thinking of him, have these verses, so frequently sung by
him, come to my mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">E&rsquo;er since by faith I saw the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Thy flowing wounds supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Redeeming love has been my theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">And shall be till I die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Then, in a nobler, sweeter song,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">I&rsquo;ll sing Thy power to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">When this poor lisping, stammering tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Is silent in the grave.<br /></span>
</div></div>

</div>
<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s continued to be the military church of
Cawnpore till 1857, when it was destroyed in the Mutiny.
Its place has been taken by a Memorial Church which
visibly proclaims forgiveness and peace on the never-to-be
forgotten site of Wheeler&rsquo;s entrenchment&mdash;consecrated
ground indeed!</p>

<p>On October 1 he left Cawnpore, &lsquo;after a parting prayer
with my dearest brother Corrie,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> to whom he wrote from
Allahabad:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>Thus far we are come in safety; but my spirits tell me
that I have parted with friends. Your pale face as it
appeared on Monday morning is still before my eyes, and
will not let me be easy till you tell me you are strong and
prudent. The first night there blew a wind so bleak and
cold, through and through my boat and bed, that I rose,
as I expected, with a pain in the breast, which has not
quite left me, but will, I hope, to-night, when I shall take
measures for expelling it. There is a gate not paid for yet
belonging to the churchyard, may you always go through
it in faith and return through it with praise. You are now
in prayer with our men. The Lord be with you, and be
always with you, dearest brother.</p></div>

<p>Ministering to all who needed his services, in preaching,
baptizing, and marrying, on his way down the great
Ganges, at Benares, at Ghazipore, where he met with &lsquo;the
remains&rsquo; of his old 67th regiment, at Bhagulpore, and at
Bandel, where he called on the Roman Catholics, on
November 12 he at last came to Aldeen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>Children jumping, shouting, and convoying me in
troops to the house. They are a lovely family indeed, and
I do not know when I have felt so delighted as at family
worship last night. To-day Mr. Brown and myself have
been consulting at the Pagoda.</p></div>

<p>After four years&rsquo; absence he seemed a dying man to his
Serampore and Calcutta friends, Brown, Thomason, Udny,
and Colonel Young of Dinapore memory. But he was ever
cheerful, and he preached every Sunday for five weeks,
though in his <i>Journal</i> we find this on November 21:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Caught a cold, and kept awake much of the night by a
cough. From this day perhaps I may date my decay.
Nature shrinks from dissolution, and conscience trembles
at the thought of a judgment to come. But I try to
rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><i>November 25.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached at the old church,
on &lsquo;While Paul reasoned of righteousness,&rsquo; etc. The
Governor-General, Lord Minto, was present, desiring, as
was supposed, to abolish the distinction which had been
made between the two churches. One passage in my sermon
appeared to some personal, and on reconsideration
I thought it so myself, and was excessively distressed
at having given causeless offence, and perhaps preventing
much good. Lord! pardon a blind creature. How much
mischief may I do through mere thoughtlessness!</p>

<p><i>December 2.</i>&mdash;Preached at eight, on &lsquo;Grace reigns,&rsquo; and
was favoured with strength of body and joy of heart in
proclaiming the glorious truth.</p>

<p><i>December 25.</i>&mdash;Preached, with much comfort to myself,
on &lsquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son,&rsquo; etc. Mr. Brown on &lsquo;Let your light so shine before
men,&rsquo; etc. The whole sum collected about seven thousand
rupees. At night Mr. Thomason on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> &lsquo;Through the tender
mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high
hath visited us.&rsquo; This day how many of those who love
the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity are rejoicing in His birth.
My dear Lydia remembers me.</p>

<p><i>December 31.</i>&mdash;Had a long dispute with Marshman,
which brought on pain in the chest.</p></div>

<p>He opened the year 1811 by preaching for the new
Calcutta Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society
his published sermon on Christian India and the Bible, to
be read in the light of his own translation work hereafter.
He thus on the same day committed himself to the future
in the spirit of St. Paul:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1811.</i>&mdash;The weakness which has come upon me in the
course of the last year, if it should not give an entire new
turn to my life, is likely to be productive of events in the
course of the present year which I little expected, or at
least did not expect so soon. I now pass from India to
Arabia, not knowing what things shall befall me there; but
assured that an ever-faithful God and Saviour will be with
me in all places whithersoever I go. May He guide and
protect me, and after prospering me in the thing
whereunto I go, bring me back again to my delightful
work in India. It would be a painful thought indeed,
to suppose myself about to return no more. Having
succeeded, apparently, through His blessing, in the Hindustani
New Testament, I feel much encouraged, and could
wish to be spared in order to finish the Bible.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> &lsquo;He was at that time married to his seventh wife; that is, according to
his own account. Ameena was a pretty young woman, though particularly
dark for a purdah-walla, or one, according to the Eastern custom, who is
supposed always to sit behind a purdah, or curtain. She occupied the smaller
bungalow, which adjoined the larger by a long, covered passage. Our
children often went to see her whilst they were at Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s, and I paid
her one formal visit. I found her seated on the ground, encircled by cushions
within gauze mosquito-curtains, stretched by ropes from the four corners of
the hall. In the daytime these curtains were twisted and knotted over her
head, and towards the night they were let down around her, and thus she
slept where she had sat all day. She had one or two women in constant
attendance upon her, though her husband was a mere subordinate. These
Eastern women have little idea of using the needle, and very few are taught
any other feminine accomplishment. Music and literature, dancing and
singing, are known only to the Nautch or dancing-girls by profession.
Hence, nothing on earth can be imagined to be more monotonous than the
lives of women in the East; such, I mean, as are not compelled to servile
labour. They sit on their cushions behind their curtains from day to day,
from month to month, with no other occupation than that of having their
hair dressed, and their nails and eyelids stained, and no other amusement than
hearing the <i>gup</i>, or gossip of the place where they may happen to be; nor is
any gossip too low or too frivolous to be unacceptable. The visits of our
children and nurses were very acceptable to Ameena, and she took much and
tender notice of the baby. She lived on miserable terms with her husband,
and hated him most cordially. She was a Mussulman, and he was very
anxious to make her a Christian, to which she constantly showed strong
opposition. At length, however, she terminated the controversy in the
following extraordinary manner: &ldquo;Pray, will you have the goodness to inform
me where Christians go after death?&rdquo; &ldquo;To heaven and to their
Saviour,&rdquo; replied Sabat. &ldquo;And where do Mahometans go?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;To hell and the devil,&rdquo; answered the fierce Arab. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said the meek
wife, &ldquo;will go to heaven, of course, as being a Christian.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
replied Sabat. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will continue to be a Mussulman,
because I should prefer hell and the devil without you, to heaven itself in
your presence.&rdquo; This anecdote was told to Mr. Martyn by Sabat himself, as
a proof of the hardened spirit of his wife.
</p><p>
&lsquo;Ameena was, by the Arab&rsquo;s own account, his seventh wife. He had some
wonderful story to tell of each of his former marriages; but that which he
related of his sixth wife exceeded all the rest in the marvellous and the romantic.
He told this tale at Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s table one evening, whilst we were at supper,
during the week we lived in the house. He spoke in Persian, and Mr. Martyn
interpreted what he said, and it was this he narrated: It was on some occasion,
he said, in which Fortune had played him one of her worst tricks, and reduced
him to a state of the most abject poverty, that he happened to arrive one night
at a certain city, which was the capital of some rajah, or petty king&mdash;Sabat
called this person a king. It seemed he arrived at a crisis in which the king&rsquo;s
only daughter had given her father some terrible offence, and in order to be
revenged upon her, the father issued his commands that she should be compelled
to take for her husband the first stranger who arrived in the town after
sunset. This man happened to be our Arab; he was accordingly seized and
subjected to the processes of bathing and anointing with precious oil. He
was then magnificently dressed, introduced into the royal hall, and duly
married to the princess, who proved not only to be fair as the houris, but to
be quite prepared to love the husband whom Fortune had sent her. He lived
with her, he pretended, I know not how many years, and they were perfectly
happy until the princess died, and he lost the favour of his majesty. I think
that Sabat laid the scene of this adventure in or near Agra. But this could
hardly be. That such things have been in the East&mdash;that is, that royal parents
have taken such means of avenging themselves on offending daughters&mdash;is
quite certain; but I cannot venture to assert that Sabat was telling the truth
when he made himself the hero of the tale.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> We have these reminiscences of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s Cawnpore from Bishop
Corrie, when, as Archdeacon of Calcutta, he again visited it. In 1824 he
writes: &lsquo;I arrived at this station on the day fourteen years after sainted
Martyn had dedicated the church. The house he occupied stands close by.
The view of the place and the remembrance of what had passed greatly
affected me.... I had to assist in administering the sacrament, and well it
was, on the whole, that none present could enter into my feelings, or I should
have been overcome.&rsquo; Again: &lsquo;How would it have rejoiced the heart of
Martyn could he have had the chief authorities associated, by order of Government,
to assist him in the work of education; and how gladly would he have
made himself their servant in the work for Jesus&rsquo; sake! One poor blind man
who lives in an outhouse of Martyn&rsquo;s, and received a small monthly sum from
him, often comes to our house, and affords a mournful pleasure in reminding
me of some little occurrence of those times. A wealthy native too, who lived
next door to us, sent his nephew to express to me the pleasure he derived from
his acquaintance with Martyn. These are all the traces I have found of that
&ldquo;excellent one of the earth&rdquo; at the station.&rsquo;
</p><p>
In 1833 Corrie was again at Cawnpore, which had two chaplains then, and
thus wrote: &lsquo;<i>October 6.</i>&mdash;I attended Divine service at the church bungalow,
and stood up once more in Martyn&rsquo;s pulpit. The place is a little enlarged.
The remembrance of Martyn and the Sherwoods, and Mary (his sister), with
the occupations of that period, came powerfully to my recollection, and I
could not prevent the tears from flowing. A sense of the forgiving love of
God, with the prospect of all joining in thankful adoration in the realms of
bliss, greatly preponderates.&rsquo;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="subheading">FROM CALCUTTA TO CEYLON, BOMBAY, AND ARABIA</p>


<p>Two motives made Henry Martyn eager to leave India for
a time, and to cease the strain on his fast-ebbing strength,
caused by incessant preaching and speaking: he desired
to prolong his life, but to prolong it only till he should give
the Mohammedans of Arabia and Persia the Word of God
in their own tongues. After his first, almost fatal, attack
at Dinapore, Corrie, who had gone to help him in his duties,
wrote to &lsquo;the Patriarch,&rsquo; as they called Mr. Brown, at
Aldeen: &lsquo;He wishes to be spared on account of the translations,
but with great earnestness said, &ldquo;I wish to have
my whole soul swallowed up in the will of God.&rdquo;&rsquo; Two
years after, Corrie wrote to England from Cawnpore: &lsquo;He
is going to try sea air. May God render it effectual to his
restoration. His life is beyond all price to us. You know
what a profound scholar he is, and all his acquirements are
dedicated to the service of Christ. If ever man, since St.
Paul, could use these words, he may, <i>One thing I do</i>. But
the length of his life will depend on his desisting from
public duties.&rsquo; To Martyn himself, when at last he had
left Cawnpore, Corrie wrote: &lsquo;If you will not take rest,
dear brother, come away back;&rsquo; informing him, at the
same time, that he had returned to a Colonel, whom he had
married, 1,600 rupees, he and Martyn having resolved to
decline all fees for marrying and burying in India, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
such were a stumbling-block in the way of morality and
religion, constituted as Anglo-Indian society was at that
time.</p>

<p>When he was leaving Cawnpore, Henry Martyn was
about to destroy what he called &lsquo;a number of memorandums.&rsquo;
These afterwards proved to be his <i>Journals</i> from
January 1803 to 1811, some of which were written in Latin,
and some in Greek, for greater secrecy. Corrie remonstrated
with him, and persuaded him to seal them up and leave
them in his hands. Lord Minto, the Governor-General, and
General Hewett, the Commander-in-chief, after receiving a
statement of Martyn&rsquo;s object, gave their sanction to his
spending his sick-leave in Persia and Syria. At first the
only ship he could find bound for Bombay, <i>en route</i> to the
Persian Gulf, was one of the native buggalows which carried
the coasting trade in the days before the British India
Steam Navigation Company had begun to develop the
commerce of the Indian Ocean all along East Africa,
Southern Asia, the Spice Islands, and Australasia. But
he wrote to Corrie:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The captain of the ship after many excuses has at last
refused to take me, on the ground that I might try to
convert the Arab sailors, and so cause a mutiny in the
ship. So I am quite out of heart, and more than half
disposed to go to the right about, and come back to
Cawnpore.</p></div>

<p>His uncompromising earnestness as a witness for Christ
was well known. Fortunately, a month after, the Honourable
Mountstuart Elphinstone &lsquo;was proceeding to take the
residency of Poona,&rsquo; and Martyn secured a passage in the
same ship, the Hummoody, an Arab coaster belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
a Muscat merchant, and manned by his Abyssinian slave
as Nakhoda.</p>

<p>His last message to Calcutta, on the evening of
the first Sunday of the year 1811, was on <i>The one thing
needful</i>. Next morning he quietly went on board Mr.
Elphinstone&rsquo;s pinnace &lsquo;without taking leave of my two dear
friends in Calcutta.&rsquo; As they dropped down the Hoogli,
anchoring for two nights in its treacherous waters, his
henceforth brief entries in his <i>Journal</i> are these: &lsquo;8th. Conversation
with Mr. Elphinstone, and disputes with his
Persian moulvi, left me weak and in pain. 9th. Reached the
ship at Saugur, and began to try my strength with the
Arab sailors.&rsquo; He found that the country-born captain,
Kinsay, had been brought up by Schwartz, and he obtained
from him much information regarding the habits and the
rule of the Lutheran apostle of Southern India. This is
new:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was said that Schwartz had a warning given him of
his death. One clear moonlight night he saw a light, and
heard a voice which said to him, &lsquo;Follow me.&rsquo; He got up
and went to the door; here the vision vanished. The next
day he sent for Dr. Anderson and said, &lsquo;An old tree must
fall.&rsquo; On the doctor&rsquo;s perceiving there was nothing the
matter with him, Schwartz asked him whether he observed
any disorder in his intellect; to which the doctor replied,
&lsquo;No.&rsquo; He and General Floyd (now in Ireland), another
friend of Schwartz, came and stayed with him. The next
fifteen days he was continually engaged in devotion, and
attended no more to the school: on the last day he died

<p>Henry Martyn was well fitted by culture and training
to appreciate the society of such statesmen and thinkers as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Mountstuart Elphinstone, Sir John Malcolm, Sir James
Mackintosh, and Jonathan Duncan, who in their turn delighted
in his society during the next five weeks. Of the
first he wrote to Corrie: &lsquo;His agreeable manners and classical
acquirements made me think myself fortunate indeed
in having such a companion, and I found his company the
most agreeable circumstance in my voyage.&rsquo; They walked
together in the cinnamon groves of Ceylon, when the ship
touched at Colombo; together they talked of the work of
Xavier as they skirted Cape Comorin, and observed Portuguese
churches every two or three miles, with a row of
huts on each side. &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; he wrote in his <i>Journal</i>,
&lsquo;many of these poor people, with all the incumbrances
of Popery, are moving towards the kingdom of heaven.&rsquo;
Together the two visited old Goa, the ecclesiastical capital,
its convents and churches. The year after their visit the
Goa Inquisition, one of the cruellest of its branches since
its foundation, was suppressed. Henry Martyn&rsquo;s letters
to Lydia Grenfell best describe his experiences and
impressions:</p>

<span class="smcap">To Lydia Grenfell</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
At Sea, Coast of Malabar: February 4, 1811.<br />
</p>

<p>The last letter I wrote to you, my dearest Lydia, was
dated November 1810. I continued in Calcutta to the
end of the year, preaching once a week, and reading the
Word in some happy little companies, with whom I enjoyed
that sweet communion which all in this vale of tears have
reason to be thankful for, but especially those whose lot is
cast in a heathen land. On New-year&rsquo;s day, at Mr. Brown&rsquo;s
urgent request, I preached a sermon for the Bible Society,
recommending an immediate attention to the state of the
native Christians. At the time I left Calcutta they talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of forming an auxiliary society. Leaving Calcutta was so
much like leaving England, that I went on board my boat
without giving them notice, and so escaped the pain of
bidding them farewell. In two days I met my ship at the
mouth of the river, and we put to sea immediately. Our
ship is commanded by a pupil of Schwartz, and manned
by Arabians, Abyssinians, and others. One of my fellow-passengers
is Mr. Elphinstone, who was lately ambassador
at the court of the King of Cabul, and is now going to be
resident at Poona, the capital of the Mahratta empire. So
the group is rather interesting, and I am happy to say not
averse to religious instruction; I mean the Europeans.
As for the Asiatics, they are in language, customs, and
religion, as far removed from us as if they were inhabitants
of another planet. I speak a little Arabic sometimes to
the sailors, but their contempt of the Gospel, and attachment
to their own superstition, make their conversion
appear impossible. How stupendous that power which
can make these people the followers of the Lamb, when
they so nearly resemble Satan in pride and wickedness!
The first part of the voyage I was without employment,
and almost without thought, suffering as usual so much
from sea sickness, that I had not spirits to do anything but
sit upon the poop, surveying the wide waste of waters blue.
This continued all down the Bay of Bengal. At length in
the neighbourhood of Ceylon we found smooth water, and
came to an anchor off Colombo, the principal station in
the island. The captain having proposed to his passengers
that they should go ashore and refresh themselves with a
walk in the cinnamon gardens, Mr. Elphinstone and myself
availed ourselves of the offer, and went off to inhale the
cinnamon breeze. The walk was delightful. The huts of
the natives, who are (in that neighbourhood at least) most
of them Protestants, are built in thick groves of cocoanut-tree,
with openings here and there, discovering the
sea. Everything bore the appearance of contentment. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
contemplated them with delight, and was almost glad that I
could not speak with them, lest further acquaintance should
have dissipated the pleasing ideas their appearance gave
birth to. In the gardens I cut off a piece of the bark for
you. It will not be so fragrant as that which is properly
prepared; but it will not have lost its fine smell, I hope,
when it reaches you.</p>

<p>At Captain Rodney&rsquo;s, the Chief Secretary to Government,
we met a good part of the European society of
Colombo. The party was like most mixed parties in
England, where much is said that need not be remembered.
The next day we stretched across the Gulf of Manaar, and
soon came in sight of Cape Comorin, the great promontory
of India. At a distance the green waves seemed to wash
the foot of the mountain, but on a nearer approach little
churches were seen, apparently on the beach, with a row of
little huts on each side. Was it these maritime situations
that recalled to my mind Perran church and town in the
way to Gurlyn; or that my thoughts wander too often on
the beach to the east of Lamorran? You do not tell me
whether you ever walk there, and imagine the billows that
break at your feet to have made their way from India.
But why should I wish to know? Had I observed silence
on that day and thenceforward, I should have spared you
much trouble, and myself much pain. Yet I am far from
regretting that I spoke, since I am persuaded that all
things will work together for good. I sometimes try to
put such a number of things together as shall produce the
greatest happiness possible, and I find that even in imagination
I cannot satisfy myself. I set myself to see what is
that &lsquo;good for the sons of men, which they should do
under heaven all the days of their life,&rsquo; and I find that
paradise is not here. Many things are delightful, some
things are almost all one could wish; but yet in all beauty
there is deformity, in the most perfect something wanting,
and there is no hope of its ever being otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> &lsquo;That
which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which
is wanting cannot be numbered.&rsquo; So that the expectation
of happiness on earth seems chimerical to the last degree.
In my schemes of happiness I place myself of course with
you, blessed with great success in the ministry, and seeing
all India turning to the Lord. Yet it is evident that with
these joys there would be mingled many sorrows. The
care of all the churches was a burden to the mighty mind
of St. Paul. As for what we should be together, I judge
of it from our friends. Are they quite beyond the vexations
of common life? I think not&mdash;still I do not say that
it is a question whether they gained or lost by marrying.
Their affections will live when ours (I should rather say
mine) are dead. Perhaps it may not be the effect of celibacy;
but I certainly begin to feel a wonderful indifference
to all but myself. From so seldom seeing a creature that
cares for me, and never one that depends at all upon me,
I begin to look round upon men with reciprocal apathy.
It sometimes calls itself deadness to the world, but I much
fear that it is deadness of heart. I am exempt from worldly
cares myself, and therefore do not feel for others. Having
got out of the stream into still water, I go round and round
in my own little circle. This supposed deterioration you
will ascribe to my humility; therefore I add that Mr.
Brown could not help remarking the difference between
what I am and what I was, and observed on seeing my
picture, which was taken at Calcutta for Mr. Simeon, and
is thought a striking likeness, that it was not Martyn that
arrived in India, but Martyn the recluse.</p>

<p><i>February 10.</i>&mdash;To-day my affections seem to have revived
a little. I have been often deceived in times past,
and erroneously called animal spirits joy in the Holy
Ghost. Yet I trust that I can say with truth, &lsquo;To them
who believe, He is precious!&rsquo; Yes, Thou art precious to
my soul, my transport and my trust. No thought now is
so sweet as that which those words suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>&mdash;&lsquo;<i>In Christ</i>.&rsquo;
Our destinies thus inseparably united with those of the
Son of God, what is too great to be expected? All things
are yours, for ye are Christ&rsquo;s! We may ask what we will,
and it shall be given to us. Now, why do I ever lose sight
of Him, or fancy myself without Him, or try to do anything
without Him? Break off a branch from a tree, and how
long will it be before it withers? To-day, my beloved
sister, I rejoice in you before the Lord, I rejoice in you as
a member of the mystic body, I pray that your prayers for
one who is unworthy of your remembrance may be heard,
and bring down tenfold blessings on yourself. How good
is the Lord in giving me grace to rejoice with His chosen
all over the earth; even with those who are at this moment
going up with the voice of joy and praise, to tread His courts
and sing His praise. There is not an object about me but
is depressing. Yet my heart expands with delight at the
presence of a gracious God, and the assurance that my
separation from His people is only temporary.</p>

<p>On the 7th we landed at Goa, the capital of the Portuguese
possessions in the East. I reckoned much on my
visit to Goa, expecting, from its being the residence of the
archbishop and many ecclesiastics, that I should obtain such
information about the Christians in India as would render
it superfluous to make inquiries elsewhere, but I was much
disappointed. Perhaps it was owing to our being accompanied
by several officers, English and Portuguese, that
the archbishop and his principal agents would not be seen;
but so it was, that I scarcely met with a man who could
make himself intelligible. We are shown what strangers
are usually shown, the churches and monasteries, but I
wanted to contemplate man, the only thing on earth almost
that possesses any interest for me. I beheld the stupendous
magnificence of their noble churches without emotion, except
to regret that the Gospel was not preached in them.
In one of the monasteries we saw the tomb of Francis
Xavier, the Apostle of India, most richly ornamented, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
well as the room in which it stands, with paintings and
figures in bronze, done in Italy. The friar who showed us
the tomb, happening to speak of the grace of God in the
heart, without which, said he, as he held the sacramental
wafer, the body of Christ profits nothing. I began a conversation
with him, which, however, came to nothing.</p>

<p>We visited among many other places the convent of
nuns. After a long altercation with the lady porter we
were admitted to the antechamber, in which was the grate,
a window with iron bars, behind which the poor prisoners
make their appearance. While my companions were purchasing
their trinkets I was employed in examining their
countenances, which I did with great attention. In what
possible way, thought I, can you support existence, if you
do not find your happiness in God? They all looked ill
and discontented, those at least whose countenances expressed
anything. One sat by reading, as if nothing were
going on. I asked to see the book, and it was handed
through the grate. Finding that it was a Latin prayer-book,
I wrote in Latin something about the love of the
world, which seclusion from it would not remove. The
Inquisition is still existing at Goa. We were not admitted
as far as Dr. Buchanan was, to the Hall of Examination,
and that because he printed something against the inquisitors
which came to their knowledge. The priest in waiting
acknowledged that they had some prisoners within the
walls, and defended the practice of imprisoning and chastising
offenders, on the ground of its being conformed to
the custom of the Primitive Church. We were told that
when the officers of the Inquisition touch an individual,
and beckon him away, he dares not resist; if he does not
come out again, no one must ask about him; if he does, he
must not tell what was done to him.</p>

<p><i>February 18.</i>&mdash;(Bombay.) Thus far I am brought in
safety. On this day I complete my thirtieth year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> &lsquo;Here
I raise my Ebenezer; Hither by Thy help I&rsquo;m come.&rsquo;
27th. It is sweet to reflect that we shall at last reach our
home. I am here amongst men who are indeed aliens to
the commonwealth of Israel and without God in the world.
I hear many of those amongst whom I live bring idle
objections against religion, such as I have answered a
hundred times. How insensible are men of the world to
all that God is doing! How unconscious of His purposes
concerning His Church! How incapable, seemingly, of comprehending
the existence of it! I feel the meaning of St.
Paul&rsquo;s words&mdash;&lsquo;Hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of
His will, that He would gather in one all things in Christ.&rsquo;
Well! let us bless the Lord. &lsquo;All thy children shall be
taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy
children.&rsquo; In a few days I expect to sail for the Gulf of
Persia in one of the Company&rsquo;s sloops of war.</p>

<p>Farewell, my beloved Lydia, and believe me to be ever
yours most affectionately,</p>

</div>

<p>All through the voyage, in the Bay of Bengal and the
Indian Ocean, the scholar was busy with his books, the
Hebrew Old Testament, &lsquo;reading Turkish grammar, Niebuhr&rsquo;s
<i>Arabia</i>, making extracts from Maracci&rsquo;s <i>Refutation of
the Koran</i>, in general reading the Word of God with pleasure.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>February 10.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Somewhat of a happy
Sabbath; I enjoyed communion with the saints, though far
removed from them; service morning and night in the cabin.</p>

<p><i>January 14</i> to <i>17</i>.&mdash;When sitting on the poop Mr.
Elphinstone kindly entertained me with information about
India, the politics of which he has had such opportunities
of making himself acquainted with. The Afghans, to
whom he went as ambassador, to negotiate a treaty of
alliance in case of invasion by the French, possess a tract
of country considerably larger than Great Britain, using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the Persian and Pushtu languages. Their chief tribe is the
Doorani, from which the king is elected. Shah Zeman
was dethroned by his half-brother Mahmood, governor of
Herat, who put out his eyes. Shah Zeman&rsquo;s younger
brother Shoujjah took up arms, and after several defeats
established himself for a time. He was on the throne
when Mr. Elphinstone visited him, but since that
Mahmood has begun to dispute the sovereignty with him.
Mr. Elphinstone has been with Holkar and Sindia a
good deal. Holkar he described as a little spitfire, his
general, Meer Khan, possessed abilities; Sindia none;
the Rajah of Berar the most politic of the native powers,
though the Nizam the most powerful; the influence of
residents at Nagpoor and Hyderabad very small.</p>

<p><i>February 17.</i>&mdash;Mostly employed in writing the Arabic
tract, also in reading the Koran; a book of geography
in Arabic, and <i>Jami Abbari</i> in Persian.</p>

<p>I would that all should adore, but especially that I
myself should lie prostrate. As for self, contemptible self,
I feel myself saying, let it be forgotten for ever; henceforth
let Christ live, let Christ reign, let Him be glorified for ever.</p>

<p><i>February 18.</i>&mdash;Came to anchor at Bombay. This day
I finish the 30th year of my unprofitable life, an age in
which Brainerd had finished his course. He gained about
a hundred savages to the Gospel; I can scarcely number the
twentieth part. If I cannot act, and rejoice, and love with
the ardour some did, oh, let me at least be holy, and sober,
and wise. I am now at the age at which the Saviour of
men began His ministry, and at which John the Baptist
called a nation to repentance. Let me now think for myself
and act with energy. Hitherto I have made my youth
and insignificance an excuse for sloth and imbecility: now
let me have a character, and act boldly for God.</p>

<p><i>February 19.</i>&mdash;Went on shore. Waited on the Governor,
and was kindly accommodated with a room at the Government
House.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>The Governor was the good Jonathan Duncan, in the
last year of his long administration and of his benevolent
life. In the first decade of the nineteenth century Bombay
was a comparatively little place, but the leaders of its
English society were all remarkable men. In the short
time, even then, Bombay had become the political and
social centre of all the Asiatics and Africans, from Higher
Asia, the Persian Gulf, and Arabia, to Abyssinia, Zanzibar,
and the Comoro Isles; especially had it then begun to be
what every generation since has made it more and more,
the best centre from which to direct a Christian mission to
the Mohammedans. With Poona, it is the capital of the
most subtle and unimpressionable class, the Marathi
Brahmans, and it is the point from which most widely to
influence the Parsees. But as a base of operations against
Islam it has never yet been fully used or appreciated. The
late Hon. Ion Keith-Falconer preferred Aden, or the neighbouring
village of Sheikh Othman, the British door into
Arabia, of which he took possession for the Master by there
laying down his life in the ripeness of his years, his scholarship,
and his prosperity. But even in Arabia such work
may be directed from Bombay. The city, like its harbour
for commerce, stands without a rival as a missionary and
civilising focus. Henry Martyn spent his weeks there
in mastering the needs of its varied races and religionists,
Jewish and Arabic, Persian and Brahman, talking with representative
men of all the cults, and striving to influence
them. He kept steadily in view his duty to the Mohammedans,
writing his Arabic tract, and consulting as to his
Persian translation of the Scriptures. It was not given to
him to remain there. Dr. Taylor, whom he had joined with
Brown and the Serampore Brotherhood at Aldeen in com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>mending
to God, was hard at work on the Malayalim New
Testament, and he often visited the press to see the sacred
work in progress. It was to be the life task of the Scottish
Dr. John Wilson, twenty years after, to use Bombay as
the missionary key of the peoples who border the Indian
Ocean.</p>

<p>The friend of Mountstuart Elphinstone and guest of
the Governor, Henry Martyn was welcomed by the literary
society of the city, which at that time was unrivalled in
the East. It is fortunate that we thus obtain an impartial
estimate of his personal character and scholarship
from such men as Elphinstone, Mackintosh, and Malcolm.
In their journals and letters, written with all the frankness
of private friendship, we see the consistent and ever-watchful
saint, but at the same time the lively talker, the
brilliant scholar, and, above all, the genial companion and
even merry comrade. Since he had left Cambridge Henry
Martyn had not enjoyed society like this, able to appreciate
his many-sided gifts, and to call forth his natural joyfulness.
In Bombay we see him at his best all round as man,
scholar, saint, and missionary.</p>

<p>In Sir T.E. Colebrooke&rsquo;s Life of that most eminent
Indian statesman who twice refused the crown of the
Governor-General,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> we find Mountstuart Elphinstone
writing thus to his friend Strachey:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> &lsquo;We have in Mr.
Martyn an excellent scholar, and one of the mildest,
cheerfullest, and pleasantest men I ever saw. He is extremely
religious, and disputes about the faith with the
Nakhoda, but talks on all subjects, sacred and profane,
and makes others laugh as heartily as he could do if he
were an infidel. We have people who speak twenty-five
languages (not apiece) in the ship.&rsquo; Again, in his Journal
of July 10, 1811, Elphinstone has this entry: &lsquo;Mr. Martyn
has proved a far better companion than I reckoned on,
though my expectations were high. His zeal is unabated,
but it is not troublesome, and he does not press disputes
and investigate creeds. He is familiar with Greek and
Latin, understands French and Italian, speaks Persian and
Arabic, has translated the Scriptures into Hindustani, and
is translating the Old Testament from Hebrew. He was
an eminent mathematician even at Cambridge, and, what
is of more consequence, he is a man of good sense and
taste, and simple in his manners and character, and cheerful
in his conversation.&rsquo; He who, in the close intimacy
of shipboard life in the tropics, could win that eulogy
from a critic so lofty and so experienced, must have
been at once more human and more perfect than his
secret <i>Journal</i>, taken alone, has led its readers to believe
possible.</p>

<p>Sir John Malcolm, fresh from his second mission to
Persia, was writing his great <i>History of Persia</i> in the quiet
of Parell and Malabar Hill, with the help of the invaluable
criticism of Sir James Mackintosh, whom he described to his
brother Gilbert as &lsquo;a very extraordinary man.&rsquo; Malcolm
introduced Mackintosh and Elphinstone to each other, and
Elphinstone lost not a day in taking Martyn to call on
the Recorder. Although the distinguished Scots Highlander,
who had become the admiring friend of Robert
Hall when they were fellow students at Aberdeen University,
was in full sympathy with missionary enthusiasm, and
condemned the intolerance of the East India Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Martyn and he did not at first &lsquo;cotton&rsquo; to each other.
The former wrote thus of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1811, February 22.</i>&mdash;Talked a good deal with the
Governor about my intended journey.</p>

<p><i>February 23.</i>&mdash;Went with him to his residence in the
country, and at night met a large party, amongst whom
were Sir J. Mackintosh and General Malcolm: with Sir
James I had some conversation on different subjects; he
was by no means equal to my expectations.</p></div>

<p>Mackintosh&rsquo;s account of their first interview was this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>February 24.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Elphinstone introduced me
to a young clergyman called Martyn, come round from
Bengal on his way to Bussora, partly for health and partly
to improve his Arabic, as he is translating the Scriptures
into that language. He seems to be a mild and benevolent
enthusiast&mdash;a sort of character with which I am always
half in love. We had the novelty of grace before and
after dinner, all the company standing.</p></div>

<p>Again, a week after:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>March 1.</i>&mdash;Mr. Martyn, the saint from Calcutta, called
here. He is a man of acuteness and learning; his meekness
is excessive, and gives a disagreeable impression of
effort to conceal the passions of human nature.</p></div>

<p>Both had the Celtic fire, but Sir James Mackintosh had
not lived with Sabat. Another month passed, and the
two were learning to appreciate each other.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Padre Martyn, the saint, dined here in the evening; it
was a very considerably more pleasant evening than usual;
he is a mild and ingenious man. We had two or three
hours&rsquo; good discussion on grammar and metaphysics.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s growing appreciation of Mackintosh is
seen in this later passage in his <i>Journal</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1811, March 1.</i>&mdash;Called on Sir J. Mackintosh, and
found his conversation, as it is generally said to be, very
instructive and entertaining. He thought that the world
would be soon Europeanised, in order that the Gospel
might spread over the world. He observed that caste was
broken down in Egypt, and the Oriental world made Greek
by the successors of Alexander, in order to make way for
the religion of Christ. He thought that little was to be
apprehended, and little hoped for, from the exertions of
missionaries. Called at General Malcolm&rsquo;s, and though I
did not find him at home, was very well rewarded for my
trouble in getting to his house, by the company of Mr. <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>,
lately from R. Dined at Farish&rsquo;s with a party of
some very amiable and well-behaved young men. What
a remarkable difference between the old inhabitants of
India and the new-comers. This is owing to the number
of religious families in England.</p>

<p><i>March 4.</i>&mdash;Dined at General Malcolm&rsquo;s, who gave me
a Chaldee missal. Captain Stewart, who had accompanied
him as his secretary into Persia, gave me much information
about the learned men of Ispahan.</p>

<p><i>March 8.</i>&mdash;Spent the first part of the day at General
Malcolm&rsquo;s, who gave me letters of introduction and some
queries respecting the wandering tribes of Persia.</p></div>

<p>The reference to young Mr. Farish, is to one who
afterwards became interim Governor of Bombay, and the
friend of John Wilson, and who, because he taught a class
in the Sunday School that used to meet in the Town Hall,
was for the time an object of suspicion and attack by
the Parsees and Hindus, on the baptism of Dhanjibhai
Naoroji, the first Parsee to put on Christ.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>
<p>On Malcolm, according to Sir John Kaye, his biographer,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
the young Christian hero appears to have made a
more favourable impression than on Mackintosh. Perhaps
the habitual cheerfulness of his manner communicated
itself to the &lsquo;saint from Calcutta,&rsquo; of whom he wrote to Sir
Gore Ouseley, the British ambassador, that he was likely
to add to the hilarity of his party.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He requested me to give him a line to the Governor of
Bushire, which I did, as well as one to Mahomed Nebbee
Khan. But I warned him not to move from Bushire without
your previous sanction. His intention is, I believe,
to go by Shiraz, Ispahan, and Kermanshah to Baghdad,
and to endeavour on that route to discover some ancient
copies of the Gospel, which he and many other saints are
persuaded lie hid in the mountains of Persia. Mr. Martyn
also expects to improve himself as an Oriental scholar; he
is already an excellent one. His knowledge of Arabic is
superior to that of any Englishman in India. He is altogether
a very learned and cheerful man, but a great enthusiast
in his holy calling. He has, however, assured me,
and begged I would mention it to you, that he has no
thought of preaching to the Persians, or of entering into
any theological controversies, but means to confine himself
to two objects&mdash;a research after old Gospels, and the endeavour
to qualify himself for giving a correct version of
the Scriptures into Arabic and Persian, on the plan proposed
by the Bible Society.</p>

<p>I have not hesitated to tell him that I thought you
would require that he should act with great caution, and
not allow his zeal to run away with him. He declares he
will not, and he is a man of that character that I must
believe. I am satisfied that if you ever see him, you will
be pleased with him. He will give you grace before and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>

Lord&rsquo;s name in vain; but his good sense and great learning
will delight you, whilst his constant cheerfulness will
add to the hilarity of your party.</p></div>

<p>In such social intercourse in the evening, in constant
interviews and discussions with Jews and Mohammedans,
Parsees and Hindus, during the day, and in frequent
preaching for the chaplains, the weeks passed all too
rapidly. A ropemaker who had just arrived from London
called on him. &lsquo;He understood from my preaching that
he might open his heart to me. We conversed and prayed
together.&rsquo; Against this and the communion with young
Farish and his fellows, we must set the action of those
whom he thus describes in a letter to Corrie:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1811, February 26.</i>&mdash;Peacefully preaching the Word of
life to a people daily edified is the nearest approach to
heaven below. But to move from place to place, hurried
away without having time to do good, is vexatious to the
spirit as well as harassing to the body. Hearing last
Saturday that some sons of Belial, members of the Bapre
Hunt,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> intended to have a great race the following day, I
informed Mr. Duncan, at whose house I was staying, and
recommended the interference of the secular arm. He
accordingly sent to forbid it. The messengers of the Bapre
Hunt were exceedingly exasperated; some came to church
expecting to hear a sermon against hunting, but I merely
preached to them on &lsquo;the one thing needful.&rsquo; Finding
nothing to lay hold of, they had the race on Monday, and
ran <i>Hypocrite</i> against <i>Martha</i> and <i>Mary</i>.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>
<p>His last message to India, from the &lsquo;faithful saying&rsquo; of
1 Timothy i. 15, was misunderstood and resented, as his
first sermon in Calcutta had been in similar circumstances.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>March 24.</i> (Sunday).&mdash;Speaking on the evidence of
its truth, I mentioned its constant efficacy in collecting the
multitude, and commanding their attention, which moral
discourses never did. This was considered as a reflection
on the ministers of Bombay, which distressed me not a
little.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn was granted a passage to Arabia and
Persia in the Benares, Captain Sealey, one of the ships of
the old Indian Navy, ordered to cruise along with the
Prince of Wales in the Persian Gulf. At that time the
danger was considerable. For a century the Joasmi Arabs,
of &lsquo;the pirate coast&rsquo; of Oman, had been the terror of the
Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, driving off even the
early Portuguese, and confining the Persians, then invulnerable
by land, to their own shores. The Wahabee puritans
of Islam having mastered them, they added to their own
bloodthirsty love of plunder and the slave-trade the fanaticism
of Mohammed-ibn-Abdul-Wahab, the &lsquo;bestower of
blessings,&rsquo; as the name signifies. The East India Company
tolerated them, retaining two or three ships of war in the
Gulf for the protection of the factories at Gombroon,
Bushire, and Busrah. But, in an evil moment, in the
year 1797, the Joasmi pirates dared to seize a British
vessel. From that hour their fate was sealed, though the
process of clearing the southern coast of Asia of pirates
and slavers ended only with the accession of Queen
Victoria, in the year when Aden was added to the empire.
In 1809-10 the Bombay Government expedition, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Commodore John Wainwright, captured their stronghold
of Ras-ul-Khymah, delivered our feudatory of Muscat
from their terrorism, and gave the Gulf peace for ten
years. The two ships of war which conveyed the chaplain
missionary with his message of peace to Eastern Arabia
and Persia were sent to complete the work of the Wainwright
expedition,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> which had been summoned by Lord
Minto to the conquest of Java. Henry Martyn acted as
chaplain to the forty-five sailors and twelve artillerymen
who formed the European part of the crew of the Benares.
After two days at Muscat he tells the story of his voyage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Lydia Grenfell</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
Muscat: April 22, 1811.<br />
</p>

<p>My dearest Lydia,&mdash;I am now in Arabia Felix: to judge
from the aspect of the country it has little pretensions to
the name, unless burning barren rocks convey an idea of
felicity; but perhaps as there is a promise in reserve for
the sons of Joktan, their land may one day be blest
indeed.</p>

<p>We sailed from Bombay on Lady-day; and on the
morning of Easter saw the land of Mekran in Persia. After
another week&rsquo;s sail across the mouth of the Gulf, we arrived
here, and expect to proceed up the Gulf to Bushire, as soon
as we have taken in our water. You will be happy to learn
that the murderous pirates against whom we were sent,
having received notice of our approach, are all got out of
the way, so that I am no longer liable to be shot in a battle,
or to decapitation after it, if it be lawful to judge from
appearances. These pestilent Ishmaelites indeed, whose
hand is against every man&rsquo;s, will escape, and the community
suffer, but that selfish friendship of which you once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
confessed yourself guilty, will think only of the preservation
of a friend. This last marine excursion has been the
pleasantest I ever made, as I have been able to pursue my
studies with less interruption than when ashore. My little
congregation of forty or fifty Europeans does not try my
strength on Sundays; and my two companions are men
who read their Bible every day. In addition to all these
comforts, I have to bless God for having kept me more
than usually free from the sorrowful mind. We must not
always say with Watts, &lsquo;The sorrows of the mind be
banished from the place;&rsquo; but if freedom from trouble
be offered us, we may choose it rather. I do not know
anything more delightful than to meet with a Christian
brother, where only strangers and foreigners were expected.
This pleasure I enjoyed just before leaving Bombay; a
ropemaker who had just come from England, understood
from my sermon that I was one he might speak to, so he
came and opened his heart, and we rejoiced together. In
this ship I find another of the household of faith. In another
ship which accompanies us there are two Armenians
who do nothing but read the Testament. One of them will
I hope accompany me to Shiraz in Persia, which is his
native country.</p>

<p>We are likely to be detained here some days, but the
ship that will carry our letters to India sails immediately,
so that I can send but one letter to England, and one to
Calcutta. When will our correspondence be established?
I have been trying to effect it these six years, and it is only
yet in train. Why there was no letter from you in those
dated June and July 1810, I cannot conjecture, except
that you had not received any of mine, and would write
no more. But I am not yet without hopes that a letter
in the beloved hand will yet overtake me somewhere. My
kindest and most affectionate remembrances to all the
Western circle. Is it because he is your brother that I love
George so much? or because he is the last come into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
number? The angels love and wait upon the righteous
who need no repentance; but there is joy whenever another
heir of salvation is born into the family. Read Eph. i.
I cannot wish you all these spiritual blessings, since they
already are all yours; but I pray that we may have the
spirit of wisdom and knowledge to know that they are ours.
It is a chapter I keep in mind every day in prayer. We
cannot believe too much or hope too much. Happy our
eyes that they see, and our ears that they hear.</p>

<p>As it may be a year or more before I shall be back, you
may direct one letter after receiving this, if it be not of a
very old date, to Bombay, all after to Bengal, as usual.
Believe me to be ever, my dearest Lydia, your most
affectionate,</p>

through the bazaar; we wished to ascend one of the hills
in the neighbourhood, but on the native guards expressing
disapprobation, we desisted.</p></div>

to-day to, India. My conviction of being declining in
spiritual life is deeper and deeper. I would stop and
pause at what is before me. It is no particular outward
sin, but an inward loss I mourn.</p></div>

<p>Every word of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i> regarding
Arabia is precious, alike in the light of his attempt to give
its people the Word of God in their own tongue, and of the
long delayed and too brief efforts of his successors, Ion
Keith-Falconer in Yemen in 1887, and Bishop French in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Muscat in 1891. To David Brown, all unknowing of his
death, he wrote on April 23:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I left India on Lady-day, looked at Persia on Easter
Sunday, and seven days after found myself in Arabia Felix.
In a small cove, surrounded by bare rocks, heated through,
out of the reach of air as well as wind, lies the good ship
Benares, in the great cabin of which, stretched on a couch,
lie I. But though weak I am well&mdash;relaxed but not
disordered. Praise to His grace who fulfils to me a promise
which I have scarcely a right to claim&mdash;&lsquo;I am with thee,
and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Last night I went ashore for the first time with Captain
Lockett; we walked through the bazaar and up the hill,
but saw nothing but what was Indian or worse. The Imam
or Sultan is about thirty miles off, fighting, it is said, for his
kingdom, with the Wahabees.</p>

<p>You will be happy to learn that the pirates whom we
were to scourge are got out of our way, so that I may now
hope to get safe through the Gulf without being made to
witness the bloody scenes of war.</p>

<p><i>April 24.</i>&mdash;Went with one English party and two
Armenians and an Arab who served as guard and guide,
to see a remarkable pass about a mile from the town, and
a garden planted by a Hindu in a little valley beyond.
There was nothing to see, only the little bit of green in
this wilderness seemed to the Arab a great curiosity. I
conversed a good deal with him, but particularly with his
African slave, who was very intelligent about religion. The
latter knew as much about his religion as most mountaineers,
and withal was so interested, that he would not
cease from his argument till I left the shore.</p></div>

<p>To Corrie he wrote on the same day:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Imam of Muscat murdered his uncle, and sits on
the throne in the place of his elder brother, who is here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
cipher. Last night the Captain went ashore to a council
of state, to consider the relations subsisting between the
Government of Bombay and these mighty chieftains. I
attended as interpreter. The Company&rsquo;s agent is an old
Hindu who could not get off his bed. An old man in
whom pride and stupidity seemed to contend for empire
sat opposite to him. This was the Wazeer. Between
them sat I, opposite to me the Captain. The Wazeer
uttered something in Arabic, not one word of which could
I understand. The old Hindu explained in Persian, for
he has almost forgot his Hindi, and I to the Captain in
English. We are all impatient to get away from this place.</p></div>

<p>To the last he was busy with his Arabic translation of
Scripture. The ships of war crossed and recrossed the
Gulf from shore to shore, surveying its coasts and islands
in the heat of May, tempered by a north-wester which
tossed them about. On May 6 he wrote in his <i>Journal</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Much cast down through a sinful propensity, which I
little thought was in me at all, till occasion manifested its
existence.</p></div>

<p>On the 19th:</p>

which I have been making all the voyage, and extracts

<p>On May 21, 1811, Henry Martyn at last reached
Persian soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Landed at Bushire this morning in good health; how

all, make my journey a source of future good to this

hospitably received by the acting Resident. In the evening
I walked out by the sea-side to recollect myself, to review
the past, and look forward to the future.</p>

to be rendered necessary by the advanced state of the

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="subheading">IN PERSIA&mdash;BUSHIRE AND SHIRAZ, 1811</p>


<p>The Persia to whose seven millions of people Henry
Martyn was the first in modern times to carry the good-news
of God, was just the size of the India of his day.
The Mohammedan majority of its scattered inhabitants,
in cities, in villages, and wandering over its plains and
deserts, had never been, and are not yet, as Shi&rsquo;ahs, rigid
members of Islam, fanatically aggressive against all others,
like the orthodox Soonnis. After the apparent extinction
of the cult of Zoroaster and the flight of the surviving
remnant of Parsees to India, the successive ruling dynasties
were liberal and tolerant in their treatment of Christians
compared with other Moslem powers; more liberal than
Christian Russia is to the Jews and the non-&lsquo;orthodox&rsquo;
sects. When those cultured and enterprising brothers, Sir
Anthony and Sir Thomas Sherley,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> went from Oxford to
the court of Persia, then in all its magnificence under
Shah Abbas the Great, two centuries before Henry
Martyn, that Shah sent one back as Persian envoy to the
Christian powers of Europe, to establish an alliance for the
destruction of the Turks. Shah Abbas made over Gombroon
to them, calling it by his own name, Bunder Abbas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
which it still retains, and his Majesty&rsquo;s grant used such
language as this: &lsquo;Our absolute commandment, will, and
pleasure is that our countries and dominions shall be from
this day open to all Christian people <i>and to their religion</i>....
Because of the amitie now ioyned with the princes that
professe Christ, I do give this pattent for all Christian
merchants,&rsquo; etc. Only the intolerance of the Portuguese,
who, under Albuquerque, took the island of Ormuz, and so
dominated the Persian Gulf till driven out by the English,
led this great Asiatic monarch to except the power which
Prince Henry the Navigator alone redeems from historical
contempt to the present day.</p>

<p>The Suffavian dynasty gave place to the Afghan, and
that to the short-lived but wide-spreading empire of Nadir
Kooli Khan, from Delhi to the Oxus River and the Caspian
Sea. Out of half a century&rsquo;s bloody revolutions, such as
formed the normal course of the annals of Asia till Great
Britain pushed its &lsquo;Peace&rsquo; up from the Southern Ocean,
Aga Mohammed Khan, of the Kajar clan, founded the
present dynasty in 1795. His still greater nephew succeeded
on his death three years after. Futteh Ali Shah
became for the next thirty-eight years the close friend of
the British Crown and the East India Company. Shah-in-Shah,
or king of the four kings of Afghanistan, Georgia,
Koordistan, and Arabistan, the ruler of Persia had now
incorporated Arabistan in his own dominion, and had lost
Afghanistan. But he still claimed the allegiance of the
two subject-sovereigns of Georgia and Koordistan. His
uncle had avenged on the people, and especially the beautiful
women of Georgia, the transfer of the country by
its Wali to the Russian Catherine II. Placed in the
commanding centre of Western Asia, Futteh Ali almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
immediately found himself the object of eager competition
by the representatives of the Christian powers at Teheran.
His revenue was estimated by so competent an authority
as Sir John Malcolm at nearly six millions sterling. The
crown jewels, chief of them the Sea of Light, or Derya-i-Noor,
a diamond weighing 178 carats, were then the most
valuable collection in the world; for though the Koh-i-Noor
had remained with the Afghans, whence through the Sikhs
it came to a greater Shah-in-Shah, the Queen-Empress of
Great Britain, he still possessed not a little of Nadir&rsquo;s
plunder of Delhi.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Ker Porter describes him about the time
when Martyn reached his capital, as &lsquo;one blaze of jewels,&rsquo; at
the New Year festival of Norooz. On his head was a lofty
tiara of three elevations, &lsquo;entirely composed of thickly-set
diamonds, pearls, rubies, and emeralds, so exquisitely disposed
as to form a mixture of the most beautiful colours
in the brilliant light reflected from its surface. Several
black feathers, like the heron plume, were intermixed
with the resplendent aigrettes of this truly imperial diadem,
whose bending points were furnished with pear-formed
pearls of an immense size. The vesture was of gold tissue
nearly covered with a similar disposition of jewelry; and
crossing the shoulders were two strings of pearls, probably
the largest in the world. But for splendour nothing could
exceed the broad bracelets round his arms and the belt
which encircled his waist; they actually blazed like fire
when the rays of the sun met them. The throne was of
pure white marble raised a few steps from the ground, and
carpeted with shawls and cloth of gold. While the Great
King was approaching his throne, the whole assembly
continued bowing their heads to the ground till he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
taken his place. In the midst of solemn stillness, while all
eyes were fixed on the bright object before them, which
sat indeed as radiant and immovable as the image of
Mithras itself, a sort of volley of words bursting at one
impulse from the mouths of the mollahs and astrologers,
made me start, and interrupted my gaze. This strange
oratory was a kind of heraldic enumeration of the Great
King&rsquo;s titles, dominions, and glorious acts. There was a
pause, and then his Majesty spoke. The effect was even
more startling than the sudden bursting forth of the
mollahs; for this was like a voice from the tombs&mdash;so
deep, so hollow, and, at the same time, so penetratingly
loud.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>That was the man to whose feet the French Emperor
Napoleon and the Tsar Alexander, King George III. and
the greatest Governor-General of the East India Company,
the Marquess Wellesley, sent special embassies; the man
from whom they sought secret treaties, lavishing on his
courtiers more than royal gifts. To arrest the march of the
Afghan invader, who a few years before had reached Lahore
on his way to set up again at Delhi the house of Timour,
and in order to foil the secret embassy sent by Napoleon,
who had resolved to give England its death-blow through
India, a young Scotsman, Captain Malcolm, was deputed
to Teheran in 1801, following up a native envoy who had
been most successful just before. This soldier diplomatist,
who was afterwards to help Henry Martyn to a very
different success, &lsquo;bribed like a king,&rsquo; and returned with
two treaties, political and commercial, but still more with
the knowledge which fitted him to write his classic history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
and make his second ambassage. For England failed to
carry out the first so far as to help the Shah against Russia,
and from that hour Persia has seen province after province
overwhelmed by the wave from the north.</p>

<p>Taking alarm a second time, just before and after the
Peace of Tilsit, both the Crown and the Company appointed
plenipotentiaries to Teheran. It was Lord Minto&rsquo;s wise
policy to protect our Indian empire &lsquo;by binding the
Western Frontier States in a chain of friendly alliance.&rsquo;
Hence the Governor-General&rsquo;s four missions, to Sindh, to
Lahore, to Cabul, and again to Persia under Sir John
Malcolm. Sir Harford Jones appeared as ambassador from
the Crown after Malcolm had left Teheran, and took advantage
of a change in the political situation to secure
the preliminary treaty of 1809, which renewed the pledge
of its predecessor to assist the Shah with troops or a
subsidy if any European forces should invade his territories.
In a modified form this became the definitive treaty of
March 14, 1812 (further altered in that of 1814), to arrange
which Sir Gore Ouseley was sent out, superseding both
Malcolm and Jones.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Sir Gore Ouseley became Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Martyn&rsquo;s friend. Commended by Sir John Malcolm to
his personal friends among the Persians, and officially
encouraged by the British plenipotentiary, the Bengal
chaplain seeking health had all the facilities secured to him
that were possible to pursue the God-given mission of the
apostle of Christ to the peoples of Persia and Arabia.</p>

<p>The strong and wise rule of Futteh Ali Shah kept
Persia itself at peace, but he could not get the better of
Russian intrigue and attack, even with the friendly offices
of the British Government. Up till Martyn&rsquo;s arrival these
vast regions had been wrested from the Shah-in-Shah:
Georgia, Mingrelia, Daghistan, Sherwan, Karabagh, and
Talish. During his presence in the country the negotiations
with Russia were going on, which ended in 1813 in the
Treaty of Gulistan, surrendering to the Tsar all he had taken,
and apparently stopping his advance by a line of demarcation.
But as its exact direction had to be settled by
commissioners Russia has ever since continued steadily to
strip Persia of its northern lands, and only the presence of
the British Navy has kept it as yet out of the Persian Gulf.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Such were the historical and political conditions amid
which the missionary chaplain of India became a resident in
the cities, and a traveller through the villages of Persia and
Turkey at the age of thirty. He went there as the friend
of Malcolm Sahib, whose gracious dignity and lavish gifts
had made him a hero among the officials and many of the
people of Persia. He went with letters of introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
from the Governor-General of India and the Governor of
Bombay to the new British ambassador, who had lived at
Lucknow, and must have known well of his work in the
neighbouring station of Cawnpore. He went with the
reputation of a man of God in the Oriental sense, and of a
scholar who knew the sacred books of Mohammedans and
Christians alike, and who sought the good of the people.
The Armenian colonies at Calcutta and Bombay had commended
him to the many members of their Church in Persia.</p>

<p>Bushire, or Abu Shahr, at which he began his mission to
Persia, is the port of that province of Fars from which the
whole empire takes its name. Its mixed Persian and Arab
population, now numbering some fifteen thousand, its insanitary
position on a spit of sand almost surrounded by the sea,
and the filthy narrow streets hardly redeemed by the Char
Burj or citadel, and the British Residency, do not attract the
visitor, and he soon learns that the humid heat of its
climate in summer is more insupportable than that even of
the Red Sea. From Reshire, close by, in the Anglo-Persian
War of 1856-7, General Havelock shelled the town when
he pitched the camp of the force to the south of its gate.
Henry Martyn was there in the worst season of May and
June, when the thermometer rises to 100° in the shade, and
sometimes 106°. He became the guest of an English
merchant and his Armenian wife, and was received by the
Armenians as a priest of great sanctity. His <i>Journal</i>
describes his receptions and daily occupations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1811, May 23.</i>&mdash;Rode out with a party in the evening,
or rather in the afternoon, for the heat of the sun made
me ill.</p>

<p><i>May 24.</i>&mdash;The Governor called on us; also the
Armenian priest. Received an answer from the ambas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>sador,
Sir Gore Ouseley, to a letter I sent him from
Muscat.</p>

<p><i>May 25.</i>&mdash;In the evening called with the two Captains,
the Resident, and the Captain of his guard, on the Governor.
In consequence of a letter I brought for him from General
Malcolm, he was very particular in his attentions, seated
me on his own seat, and then sat by my side apart from
the rest. I observed that a Christian was not allowed to
enter a mosque; he said, &lsquo;No,&mdash;do you wish to hear the
prayers?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;No, but the preaching, if there is any;&rsquo;
he said there were no preachers except at Yezd.</p>

<p><i>May 26.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;The Europeans assembled for
Divine service, which was performed at the Resident&rsquo;s. I
preached on 1 Cor. xv.: &lsquo;For He must reign till He hath
put all enemies under His feet,&rsquo; etc. In the evening I went,
at the padre&rsquo;s request, to the Armenian church. There
was the same disagreeable succession of unmeaning ceremonies
and noisy chants as at Bombay. I was introduced
within the rails, and at the time of incense I was censed,
as the padre afterwards desired me to observe, four times,
whereas the laity have the honour done them but once.
I asked the old man what was meant by burning incense.
He said it was in imitation of the Wise Men of the East,
who offered incense to Christ. I told him, Why then do
you not offer myrrh and gold? To this he made no reply.
Walking afterwards with him by the sea-side, I tried to
get into a conversation suitable to our profession as
ministers, speaking particularly of the importance of the
charge entrusted to us. Nothing could be more vapid and
mean than his remarks.</p>

<p><i>May 27.</i>&mdash;Very ill, from head-ache and overpowering
sleepiness, arising, as I suppose, from a stroke of the sun.
As often as I attempted to read, I fell asleep, and awoke
in weakness and pain. How easily may existence be
embittered; still I will say, &lsquo;Not my will, but Thine be done.&rsquo;
In the evening a Jewish goldsmith called with a fine boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
who read the Hebrew fluently. Grief has marked the
countenance of the Eastern Jews in a way that makes
them indescribably interesting. I could have wept while
looking at them. O Lord, how long? Will Thine anger
burn for ever?&mdash;is not justice yet satisfied? This afflicted
people are as much oppressed in Persia as ever. Their
women are not allowed to veil, as all others are required to
do; hence, if there be one more than ordinarily beautiful,
she is soon known, and a khan or the king sends for her,
makes her a Mahometan, and puts her into the harem.
As soon as he is tired, she is given to another, and then to
another, till she becomes the property of the most menial
servant; such is the degradation to which the daughters of
Israel are subjected.</p>

<p><i>May 28.</i>&mdash;Through the infinite and unmerited goodness
of God I am again restored, and able to do something in
the way of reading. The Resident gave us some account
this evening of the moral state of Persia. It is enough to
make one shudder. If God rained down fire upon Sodom
and Gomorrah, how is it that this nation is not blotted out
from under heaven? I do not remember to have heard
such things of the Hindus, except the Sikhs; they seem
to rival the Mahometans.</p></div>

<p>For personal comfort and freedom from insult or attack,
Henry Martyn, when in Bushire, ordered the usual wardrobe
of a Persian gentleman. He had suffered his beard
and moustachios to vegetate undisturbed since leaving
India, as he wrote to Corrie. In conical Astrakhan cap,
baggy blue trousers, red boots, and light chintz tunic and
<i>chogha</i> or flowing coat, mounted on a riding pony, and
followed by his Armenian servant on a mule, with another
mule for his baggage, he set out on May 30, 1811, for
Shiraz. His companion was a British officer. The party
formed a large caravan with some thirty horses and mules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
carrying goods to the ambassador. They marched by
night, in the comparative coolness of 100°, to which the
thermometer fell from the noonday heat of 126°, when they
lay panting in their tents protected from the scorching dry
wind by heavy clothing. The journey of some 170 miles
occupied the first nine days of June. After ninety miles
over a hot sandy plain the traveller rises, by four rocky
<i>kotuls</i> or inclines, so steep as to be called ladders, over the
spurs of the Zagros range into a cooler region at Kaziroon,
on the central plateau of Iran, and then passes through the
most delightful valleys, wooded or clad with verdure, to the
capital, Shiraz, surrounded by gardens and by cemeteries.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>May 30.</i>&mdash;Our Persian dresses being ready, we set off
this evening for Shiraz. Our kafila consisted of about
thirty horses and mules; some carrying things to the
ambassador, the rest for our servants and luggage; the
animal for my use was a yaboo or riding pony, a mule
for my trunks, and one for my servant Zechariah, an
Armenian of Ispahan. It was a fine moonlight night,
about ten o&rsquo;clock, when we marched out of the gate of
Bushire, and began to make our way over the plain.
Mr. B., who accompanied me a little way, soon returned.
Captain T. went on, intending to accompany us to Shiraz.
This was the first time we had any of us put off the
European, and the novelty of our situation supplied us
with many subjects for conversation for about two hours.
When we began to flag and grow sleepy, and the kafila was
pretty quiet, one of the muleteers on foot began to sing: he
sang with a voice so plaintive that it was impossible not to
have one&rsquo;s attention arrested. At the end of the first tune he
paused, and nothing was heard but the tinkling of the bells
attached to the necks of the mules; every voice was hushed.
The first line was enough for me, and I dare say it set
many others thinking of their absent friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> &lsquo;Without
thee my heart can attach itself to none.&rsquo; It is what I have
often felt on setting out on a journey. The friends left
behind so absorb the thoughts, that the things by the wayside
are seen without interest, and the conversation of
strangers is insipid. But perhaps the first line, as well as
the rest, is only a promise of fidelity, though I did not take
it in that sense when I first heard it. The following is
perhaps the true translation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Think not that e&rsquo;er my heart can dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Contented far from thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">How can the fresh-caught nightingale<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Enjoy tranquillity?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Forsake not then thy friend for aught<br /></span>
<span class="i10">That slanderous tongues can say;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The heart that fixes where it ought,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">No power can rend away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus we went on, and as often as the kafila by their
dulness and sleepiness seemed to require it, or perhaps to
keep himself awake, he entertained the company and himself
with a song. We met two or three other kafilas taking
advantage of the night to get on. My loquacious servant
Zachary took care to ask every one whence they came, and
by that means sometimes got an answer which raised a
laugh against him.</p>

<p><i>June 1.</i>&mdash;At sunrise we came to our ground at Ahmeda,
six parasangs, and pitched our little tent under a tree: it
was the only shelter we could get. At first the heat was
not greater than we had felt it in India, but it soon became
so intense as to be quite alarming. When the thermometer
was above 112°, fever heat, I began to lose my strength
fast; at last it became quite intolerable. I wrapped myself
up in a blanket and all the warm covering I could get,
to defend myself from the external air; by which means
the moisture was kept a little longer upon the body, and
not so speedily evaporated as when the skin was exposed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
one of my companions followed my example, and found
the benefit of it. But the thermometer still rising, and the
moisture of the body being quite exhausted, I grew restless,
and thought I should have lost my senses. The
thermometer at last stood at 126°: in this state I composed
myself, and concluded that though I might hold out a day
or two, death was inevitable. Captain T., who sat it out,
continued to tell the hour, and height of the thermometer;
and with what pleasure did we hear of its sinking to 120°,
118°, etc. At last the fierce sun retired, and I crept out,
more dead than alive. It was then a difficulty how I could
proceed on my journey: for besides the immediate effects
of the heat, I had no opportunity of making up for the
last night&rsquo;s want of sleep, and had eaten nothing. However,
while they were loading the mules, I got an hour&rsquo;s
sleep, and set out, the muleteers leading my horse, and
Zechariah, my servant, an Armenian, of Ispahan, doing all
in his power to encourage me. The cool air of the night
restored me wonderfully, so that I arrived at our next
<i>munzil</i> with no other derangement than that occasioned
by want of sleep. Expecting another such day as the
former, we began to make preparation the instant we
arrived on the ground. I got a tattie made of the branches
of the date-tree, and a Persian peasant to water it; by
this means the thermometer did not rise higher than 114°.
But what completely secured me from the heat was a large
wet towel, which I wrapped round my head and body,
muffling up the lower part in clothes. How could I but
be grateful to a gracious Providence, for giving me so
simple a defence against what I am persuaded would have
destroyed my life that day! We took care not to go without
nourishment, as we had done: the neighbouring village
supplied us with curds and milk. At sunset, rising up to
go out, a scorpion fell upon my clothes; not seeing where
it fell, I did not know what it was; but Captain T.,
pointing it out, gave the alarm, and I struck it off, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
killed it. The night before we found a black scorpion in
our tent; this made us rather uneasy; so that though the
kafila did not start till midnight, we got no sleep, fearing
we might be visited by another scorpion.</p>

<p><i>June 2.</i>&mdash;We arrived at the foot of the mountains, at a
place where we seemed to have discovered one of Nature&rsquo;s
ulcers. A strong suffocating smell of naphtha announced
something more than ordinarily foul in the neighbourhood.
We saw a river:&mdash;what flowed in it, it seemed difficult to
say, whether it were water or green oil; it scarcely moved,
and the stones which it laved it left of a greyish colour, as
if its foul touch had given them the leprosy. Our place of
encampment this day was a grove of date-trees, where the
atmosphere, at sunrise, was ten times hotter than the
ambient air. I threw myself down on the burning ground,
and slept; when the tent came up I awoke, as usual, in a
burning fever. All this day I had recourse to the wet
towel, which kept me alive, but would allow of no sleep.
It was a sorrowful Sabbath; but Captain T. read a few
hymns, in which I found great consolation. At nine in
the evening we decamped. The ground and air were so
insufferably hot, that I could not travel without a wet towel
round my face and neck. This night, for the first time, we
began to ascend the mountains. The road often passed so
close to the edge of the tremendous precipices, that one
false step of the horse would have plunged his rider into
inevitable destruction. In such circumstances I found it
useless to attempt guiding the animal, and therefore gave
him the rein. These poor animals are so used to journeys
of this sort, that they generally step sure. There was
nothing to mark the road but the rocks being a little more
worn in one place than in another. Sometimes my horse,
which led the way, as being the muleteer&rsquo;s, stopped, as if
to consider about the way: for myself, I could not guess,
at such times, where the road lay, but he always found it.
The sublime scenery would have impressed me much, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
other circumstances; but my sleepiness and fatigue rendered
me insensible to everything around me. At last we emerged
<i>superas ad auras</i>, not on the top of a mountain to go down
again, but to a plain, or upper world. At the pass, where
a cleft in the mountain admitted us into the plain, was a
station of Rahdars. While they were examining the
muleteer&rsquo;s passports, etc., time was given for the rest of the
kafila to come up, and I got a little sleep for a few minutes.</p>

<p><i>June 4.</i>&mdash;We rode briskly over the plain, breathing a
purer air, and soon came in sight of a fair edifice, built by
the king of the country for the refreshment of pilgrims.
In this caravanserai we took our abode for the day. It
was more calculated for Eastern than European travellers,
having no means of keeping out the air and light. We
found the thermometer at 110°. At the passes we met a
man travelling down to Bushire with a load of ice, which
he willingly disposed of to us. The next night we ascended
another range of mountains, and passed over a plain, where
the cold was so piercing that with all the clothes we could
muster we were shivering. At the end of this plain we
entered a dark valley, contained by two ranges of hills
converging one to another. The muleteer gave notice
that he saw robbers. It proved to be a false alarm; but
the place was fitted to be a retreat for robbers; there being
on each side caves and fastnesses from which they might
have killed every man of us. After ascending another
mountain, we descended by a very long and circuitous
route into an extensive valley, where we were exposed to
the sun till eight o&rsquo;clock. Whether from the sun or from
continued want of sleep, I could not, on my arrival at
Kaziroon, compose myself to sleep; there seemed to be a
fire within my head, my skin like a cinder, and the pulse
violent. Through the day it was again too hot to sleep;
though the place we occupied was a sort of summer-house
in a garden of cypress-trees, exceedingly well fitted up
with mats and coloured glass. Had the kafila gone on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that night, I could not have accompanied it; but it halted
there a day, by which means I got a sort of night&rsquo;s rest,
though I awoke twenty times to dip my burning hand in
water. Though Kaziroon is the second greatest town in
Fars, we could get nothing but bread, milk, and eggs, and
those with difficulty. The Governor, who is under great
obligations to the English, heard of our arrival, but sent
no message.</p>

<p><i>June 5.</i>&mdash;At ten we left Kaziroon and ascended a
mountain: we then descended from it on the other side
into a beautiful valley, where the opening dawn discovered
to us ripe fields of wheat and barley, with the green oak
here and there in the midst of it. We were reminded of
an autumnal morning in England. Thermometer 62°.</p>

<p><i>June 6.</i>&mdash;Half-way up the Peergan Mountain we found
a caravanserai. There being no village in the neighbourhood,
we had brought supplies from Kaziroon. My servant
Zachary got a fall from his mule this morning, which much
bruised him; he looked very sorrowful, and had lost much
of his garrulity.</p>

<p><i>June 7.</i>&mdash;Left the caravanserai at one this morning,
and continued to ascend. The hours we were permitted
to rest, the mosquitoes had effectually prevented me from
using, so that I never felt more miserable and disordered;
the cold was very severe; for fear of falling off, from sleep
and numbness, I walked a good part of the way. We
pitched our tent in the vale of Dustarjan, near a crystal
stream, on the banks of which we observed the clover and
golden cup: the whole valley was one green field, in which
large herds of cattle were browsing. The temperature
was about that of spring in England. Here a few hours&rsquo;
sleep recovered me in some degree from the stupidity in
which I had been for some days. I awoke with a light
heart, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> &lsquo;He knoweth our frame, and remembereth
that we are but dust. He redeemeth our life from destruction,
and crowneth us with loving kindness and tender
mercies. He maketh us to lie down in the green pastures,
and leadeth us beside the still waters.&rsquo; And when we leave
this vale of tears, there is &lsquo;no more sorrow, nor sighing,
nor any more pain.&rsquo; &lsquo;The sun shall not light upon thee,
nor any heat; but the Lamb shall lead thee to living
fountains of waters.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;Went on to a caravanserai, three parasangs,
where we passed the day. At night set out upon our last
march for Shiraz. Sleepiness, my old companion and
enemy, again overtook me. I was in perpetual danger of
falling off my horse, till at last I pushed on to a considerable
distance beyond the kafila, planted my back against a
wall, and slept I know not how long, till the good muleteer
came up and gently waked me.</p>

<p><i>June 9.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;By daylight we found ourselves in
the plain of Shiraz. We went to the halting-place outside
the walls of the city, but found it occupied; however, after
some further delay, we were admitted with our servants
into another; as for the kafila, we saw no more of it. The
ambassador, Sir Gore Ouseley, was encamped near us;
Sir William and Major D&rsquo;Arcy, and Dr. Sharp, called on
us, but I did not see the two first, being asleep at the time.
In the evening we dined with his excellency, who gave us
a general invitation to his table. Returned to our garden,
where we slept.</p>

<p><i>June 10.</i>&mdash;Went this morning to Jaffir Ali Khan&rsquo;s, to
whom we had letters from General Malcolm, and with whom
we are to take up our abode. After the long and tedious
ceremony of coffee and <i>kaleans</i> (pipes), breakfast made
its appearance on two large trays: curry, pilaws, various
sweets cooled with snow and perfumed with rose-water,
were served in great profusion in china plates and basins,
a few wooden spoons beautifully carved; but being in a
Persian dress, and on the ground, I thought it high time
to throw off the European, and so ate with my hands.
After breakfast Jaffir took me to a summer-house in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
garden, where his brother-in-law met us, for the purpose of
a conversazione. From something I had thrown out at
breakfast about Sabat, and accident, he was curious to
know what were our opinions on these subjects. He then
began to explain his own sentiments on Soofi-ism, of which
it appeared he was a passionate admirer.</p>

<p><i>June 11.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted at Anius with some of the Embassy,
and went with them afterwards to a glass-house and
pottery. Afterwards called on Mr. Morier, secretary to
the Embassy, Major D&rsquo;Arcy, and Sir W. Ouseley. Our
host, Jaffir Ali Khan, gave us a good deal of information
this evening, about this country and government. He
used to sit for hours with the king at Teheran telling him
about India and the English.</p>

<p><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;Employed about <i>Journal</i>, writing letters,
reading <i>Gulistan</i>, but excessively indolent. In the morning
I enjoyed much comfort in prayer. What a privilege to
have a God to go to, in such a place, and in such company.
To read and pray at leisure seemed like coming home after
being long abroad. Psalm lxxxix. was a rich repast to
me. Why is it not always thus with me?</p></div>

<p>At Shiraz Henry Martyn was in the very heart of old
Persia, to which the eldest son of Shem had given his
name, Elam. One of the greatest of the Shahs, Kareem
Khan, made Shiraz his capital, instead of the not distant
Persepolis, which also Martyn visited. The founder of the
present dynasty levelled its walls and desolated its gardens,
but the city of the six gates still dominates the fine valley
which no tyrant could destroy, and has still a pleasing
appearance, though its Dewan Khana has been stripped of
the royal pillars to adorn the palace of the new capital of
Teheran. Even Timour respected Shiraz; when red with
the blood of Ispahan, he sent for Hafiz, and asked how the
poet dared to dispose of the Tartar&rsquo;s richest cities, Bokhara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
and Samarcand, for the mole on his lady&rsquo;s cheek. &lsquo;Can
the gifts of Hafiz ever impoverish Timour?&rsquo; was the
answer; and Shiraz was spared. Kareem Khan long after
built mausoleums over the dust of the Anacreon of Persia,
and over that of Sadi, its Socrates in verse, as Sir Robert
Ker Porter well describes the author of the <i>Gulistan</i>, which
was Martyn&rsquo;s daily companion at this time.</p>

<span class="caption">SHIRAZ</span>
</div>

<p>We have an account of Shiraz<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and the people of Persia,
written six years before Martyn&rsquo;s visit, by Edward Scott
Waring, Esq., of the Bengal Civil Establishment, who,
led by ill-health and curiosity, followed the same route
by Bushire and Kaziroon to the city. He is sceptical as to
those splendours which formed the theme of Hafiz, and describes
the city as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> &lsquo;worth seeing, but not worth going to see.&rsquo;
The tomb of the poet<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the Hafizieh garden he found to
be of white marble, on which two of his odes were very
beautifully cut; a few durweshes daily visited the spot
and chanted his verses. Mr. George N. Curzon, M.P.,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the
latest visitor, contrasts the grave of Hafiz with that of his
contemporary Dante, at Ravenna. Sadi&rsquo;s grave was then
quite neglected; no one had carved on it the beautiful
epitaph (paraphrased by Dryden) which he wrote for himself
on the <i>Bostan</i>: &lsquo;O passenger! who walkest over my grave,
think of the virtuous persons who have gone before me.
What has Sadi to apprehend from being turned into dust? he
was but earth when alive. He will not continue dust long,
for the winds will scatter him over the whole universe.&rsquo; Yet
as long as the garden of knowledge has blossomed not a
nightingale has warbled so sweetly in it. It would be
strange if such a nightingale should die, and not a rose
grow upon its grave. Sir Robert Ker Porter, twelve years
later, found both spots alike neglected. One poet had
written of the garden where Hafiz was buried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span> &lsquo;Paradise
does not boast such lovely banks as those of Rocknabeel,
nor such groves as the high-scented fragrance of the bowers
of Mosella.&rsquo; Another now sadly writes, &lsquo;Though the
bowers of love grew on its banks, and the sweet song
of Hafiz kept time with the nightingale and the rose, the
summer is past and all things are changed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Six years after Henry Martyn&rsquo;s residence in Shiraz,
Sir Robert Ker Porter entered the city, which to him,
as to every Christian or even English-speaking man,
became thenceforth more identified with this century&rsquo;s
apostle to the Persians than with even Hafiz and Sadi.
&lsquo;Faint with sickness and fatigue,&rsquo; he writes,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> &lsquo;I felt a
momentary reviving pleasure in the sight of a hospitable
city, and the cheerful beauty of the view. As I drew near,
the image of my exemplary countryman, Henry Martyn,
rose in my thoughts, seeming to sanctify the shelter to which
I was hastening. He had approached Shiraz much about
the same season of the year, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1811, and like myself was
gasping for life under the double pressure of an inward
fire and outward burning sun. He dwelt there nearly a
year, and on leaving its walls the apostle of Christianity
found no cause for shaking off the dust of his feet against
the Mohammedan city. The inhabitants had received,
cherished and listened to him; and he departed thence
amidst the blessings and tears of many a Persian friend.
Through his means the Gospel had then found its way into
Persia, and, as it appears to have been sown in kindly hearts,
the gradual effect hereafter may be like the harvest to the
seedling. But, whatever be the issue, the liberality with
which his doctrines were permitted to have been discussed,
and the hospitality with which their promulgation was
received by the learned, the nobles, and persons of all ranks,
cannot but reflect lasting honour on the Government, and
command our respect for the people at large. Besides,
to a person who thinks at all on these subjects, the circumstances
of the first correct Persian translation of the Holy
Scriptures being made at Shiraz, and thence put into the
royal hands and disseminated through the empire, cannot
but give an almost prophetic emphasis to the transaction,
as arising from the very native country, Persia Proper, of
the founder of the empire who first bade the temple of
Jerusalem be rebuilt, who returned her sons from captivity,
and who was called by name to the Divine commission.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the guest of Jaffir Ali Khan, now in his house in
Shiraz, and now in his orange summer garden, Henry
Martyn gave himself up to the two absorbing duties of
making a new translation of the New Testament into
Persian, assisted by his host&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Mirza Seyd
Ali Khan, and of receiving and, in the Pauline sense,
disputing with the learned Mohammedans of the city and
neighbourhood. But all through his inner life, sanctified
by his spiritual experience and intensifying that, there
continued to run the love of Lydia Grenfell.</p>

<p>How continually I think of you, and indeed converse
with you, it is impossible to say. But on the Lord&rsquo;s day
in particular, I find you much in my thoughts, because it
is on that day that I look abroad, and take a view of the
universal church, of which I observe that the saints in
England form the most conspicuous part. On that day,
too, I indulge myself with a view of the past, and look
over again those happy days, when, in company with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
I loved, I went up to the house of God with a voice of
praise. How then should I fail to remember her who, of
all that are dear to me, is the dearest? It is true that I
cannot look back upon many days, nor even many hours
passed with you&mdash;would they had been more&mdash;but we
have insensibly become more acquainted with each other,
so that, on my part at least, it may be said that separation
has brought us nearer to one another. It was a momentary
interview, but the love is lasting, everlasting. Whether
we ever meet again or not, I am sure that you will continue
to feel an interest in all that befalls me.</p>

<p>After the death of my dear sister, you bid me consider
that I had one sister left while you remained; and you
cannot imagine how consolatory to my mind this assurance
is. To know that there is one who is willing to think of
me, and has leisure to do so, is soothing to a degree that
none can know but those who have, like me, lost all their
relations.</p>

<p>I sent you a letter from Muscat, in Arabia, which I
hope you received; for if not, report will again erase my
name from the catalogue of the living, as I sent no other
to Europe. Let me here say with praise to our ever-gracious
Heavenly Father, that I am in perfect health; of
my spirits I cannot say much; I fancy they would be
better were &lsquo;the beloved Persis&rsquo; by my side. This name,
which I once gave you, occurs to me at this moment, I
suppose, because I am in Persia, entrenched in one of its
valleys, separated from Indian friends by chains of mountains
and a roaring sea, among a people depraved beyond
all belief, in the power of a tyrant guilty of every species
of atrocity. Imagine a pale person seated on a Persian
carpet, in a room without table or chair, with a pair of
formidable moustachios, and habited as a Persian, and you
see me.</p>

<p><i>June 26.</i>&mdash;Here I expect to remain six months. The
reason is this: I found on my arrival here, that our attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
at Persian translation in India were good for nothing; at
the same time they proposed, with my assistance, to make
a new translation. It was an offer I could not refuse, as
they speak the purest dialect of the Persian. My host is
a man of rank, his name Jaffir Ali Khan, who tries to
make the period of my captivity as agreeable as possible.
His wife&mdash;for he has but one&mdash;never appears; parties of
young ladies come to see her, but though they stay days
in the house, he dare not go into the room where they are.
Without intending a compliment to your sex, I must say
that the society here, from the exclusion of females, is as
dull as it can well be. Perhaps, however, to a stranger
like myself, the most social circles would be insipid. I am
visited by all the great and the learned; the former come
out of respect to my country, the latter to my profession.
The conversation with the latter is always upon religion,
and it would be strange indeed, if with the armour of
truth on the right hand and on the left, I were not able
to combat with success the upholders of such a system
of absurdity and sin. As the Persians are a far more
unprejudiced and inquisitive people than the Indians, and
do not stand quite so much in awe of an Englishman as
the timid natives of Hindustan, I hope they will learn
something from me; the hope of this reconciles me to
the necessity imposed on me of staying here; about the
translation I dare not be sanguine. The prevailing opinion
concerning me is, that I have repaired to Shiraz in order
to become a Mussulman. Others, more sagacious, say
that I shall bring from India some more, under pretence
of making them Mussulmans, but in reality to seize the
place. They do not seem to have thought of my wish to
have them converted to my religion; they have been so
long accustomed to remain without proselytes to their own.
I shall probably have very little to write about for some
months to come, and therefore I reserve the extracts of
my <i>Journal</i> since I last wrote to you for some other oppor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>tunity;
besides that, the ambassador, with whose despatches
this will go, is just leaving Shiraz.</p>

<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;The Mohammedans now come in such numbers
to visit me, that I am obliged, for the sake of my translation-work,
to decline seeing them. To-day one of the apostate
sons of Israel was brought by a party of them, to prove
the Divine mission of Mohammed from the Hebrew Scriptures,
but with all his sophistry he proved nothing. I can
almost say with St. Paul, I feel continual pity in my heart
for them, and love them for their fathers&rsquo; sake, and find a
pleasure in praying for them. While speaking of the
return of the Jews to Jerusalem, I observed that the
&lsquo;Gospel of the kingdom must first be preached in all the
world, and then shall the end come.&rsquo; He replied with a
sneer, &lsquo;And this event, I suppose you mean to say, is
beginning to take place by your bringing the Gospel to
Persia.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>July 5.</i>&mdash;I am so incessantly occupied with visitors and
my work, that I have hardly a moment for myself. I have
more and more reason to rejoice at my being sent here;
there is such an extraordinary stir about religion throughout
the city, that some good must come of it. I sometimes
sigh for a little Christian communion, yet even from these
Mohammedans I hear remarks that do me good. To-day,
for instance, my assistant observed, &lsquo;How He loved those
twelve persons!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and not those twelve only,
but all those who shall believe in Him, as He said, &ldquo;I pray
not for them alone, but for all them who shall believe on
me through their word.&rdquo;&rsquo; Even the enemy is constrained
to wonder at the love of Christ. Shall not the object of
it say, What manner of love is this? I have learned that
I may get letters from England much sooner than
by way of India. Be so good as to direct to me, to the
care of Sir Gore Ouseley, Bart., Ambassador at Teheran,
care of J. Morier, Esq., Constantinople, care of G. Moon,
Esq., Malta. I have seen Europe newspapers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
only four months&rsquo; date, so that I am delightfully near
you. May we live near one another in the unity of the
Spirit, having one Lord, one hope, one God and Father.
In your prayers for me pray that utterance may be given
me that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known
the mysteries of the Gospel. I often envy my Persian
hearers the freedom and eloquence with which they speak
to me. Were I but possessed of their powers, I sometimes
think that I should win them all; but the work is
God&rsquo;s, and the faith of His people does not stand in the
wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Remember me
as usual with the most unfeigned affection to all my dear
friends. This is now the seventh letter I send you
without having received an answer. Farewell!</p>

<p>A courier on his way to the capital affords me the
unexpected pleasure of addressing my most beloved friend.
It is now six months since I left India, and in all that time
I have not heard from thence. The dear friends there,
happy in each other&rsquo;s society, do not enough call to mind
my forlorn condition. Here I am still, beset by cavilling
infidels, and making very little progress in my translation,
and half disposed to give it up and come away. My kind
host, to relieve the tedium of being always within a walled
town, pitched a tent for me in a garden a little distance,
and there I lived amidst clusters of grapes, by the side of
a clear stream; but nothing compensates for the loss of the
excellent of the earth. It is my business, however, as you
will say, and ought to be my effort, to make saints, where
I cannot find them. I do use the means in a certain way,
but frigid reasoning with men of perverse minds seldom
brings men to Christ. However, as they require it, I
reason, and accordingly challenged them to prove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Divine mission of their prophet. In consequence of this, a
learned Arabic treatise was written by one who was considered
as the most able man, and put into my hands;
copies of it were also given to the college and the learned.
The writer of it said that if I could give a satisfactory
answer to it he would become a Christian, and at all
events would make my reply as public as I pleased. I did
answer it, and after some faint efforts on his part to defend
himself, he acknowledged the force of my arguments, but
was afraid to let them be generally known. He then
began to inquire about the Gospel, but was not satisfied
with my statement. He required me to prove from the
very beginning the Divine mission of Moses, as well as of
Christ; the truth of the Scriptures, etc. With very little
hope that any good will come of it, I am now employed
in drawing out the evidences of the truth; but oh! that I
could converse and reason, and plead with power from on
high. How powerless are the best-directed arguments till
the Holy Ghost renders them effectual.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was just on the eve of my departure
for Ispahan, as I thought, and my translator had consented
to accompany me as far as Baghdad, but just as we were
setting out, news came that the Persians and Turks were
fighting thereabouts, and that the road was in consequence
impassable. I do not know what the Lord&rsquo;s purpose may
be in keeping me here, but I trust it will be for the
furtherance of the Gospel of Christ, and in that belief I
abide contentedly.</p>

<p>My last letter to you was dated July. I desired you
to direct to me at Teheran. As it is uncertain whether I
shall pass anywhere near there, you had better direct to
the care of S. Morier, Esq., Constantinople, and I can easily
get your letters from thence.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that I am quite well, indeed, never
better; no returns of pain in the chest since I left India.
May I soon receive the welcome news that you also are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
well, and prospering even as your soul prospers. I read
your letters incessantly, and try to find out something new,
as I generally do, but I begin to look with pain at the
distant date of the last. I cannot tell what to think, but I
cast all my care upon Him who hath already done wonders
for me, and am sure that, come what will, it shall be good,
it shall be best. How sweet the privilege that we may lie
as little children before Him! I find that my wisdom is
folly and my care useless, so that I try to live on from
day to day, happy in His love and care. May that God
who hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation
and good hope through grace, bless, love, and keep my
ever-dearest friend; and dwelling in the secret place of
the Most High, and abiding under the shadow of the
Almighty, may she enjoy that sweet tranquillity which the
world cannot disturb. Dearest Lydia! pray for me, and
believe me to be ever most faithfully and affectionately
yours,</p>

<p>It is, I think, about a month since I wrote to you, and so
little has occurred since that I find scarcely anything in my
<i>Journal</i>, and nothing worth transcribing. This state of inactivity
is becoming very irksome to me. I cannot get these
Persians to work, and while they are idle I am sitting
here to no purpose. Sabat&rsquo;s laziness used to provoke me
excessively, but Persians I find are as torpid as Arabs when
their salary does not depend on their exertions, and both
very inferior to the feeble Indian, whom they affect to
despise. My translator comes about sunrise, corrects a
little, and is off, and I see no more of him for the day.
Meanwhile I sit fretting, or should do so, as I did at first,
were it not for a blessed employment which so beguiles the
tediousness of the day that I hardly perceive it passing.
It is the study of the Psalms in the Hebrew. I have long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
had it in contemplation, in the assurance, from the number
of flat and obscure passages that occur in the translations,
that the original has not been hitherto perfectly understood.
I am delighted to find that many of the most unmeaning
verses in the version turn out, on close examination, to
contain a direct reference to the Lord our Saviour. The
testimony of Jesus is indeed the spirit of prophecy. He is
never lost sight of. Let them touch what subject they
will, they must always let fall something about Him. Such
should we be, looking always to Him. I have often attempted
the 84th Psalm, endeared to me on many accounts
as you know, but have not yet succeeded. The glorious
16th Psalm I hope I have mastered. I write with the
ardour of a student communicating his discoveries and
describing his difficulties to a fellow student.</p>

<p>I think of you incessantly, too much, I fear, sometimes;
yet the recollection of you is generally attended with an
exercise of resignation to His will. In prayer I often feel
what you described five years ago as having felt&mdash;a particular
pleasure in viewing you as with me before the Lord,
and entreating our common Father to bless both His children.
When I sit and muse my spirit flies away to you,
and attends you at Gurlyn, Penzance, Plymouth Dock, and
sometimes with your brother in London. If you acknowledge
a kindred feeling still, we are not separated; our
spirits have met and blended. I still continue without
intelligence from India; since last January I have heard
nothing of any one person whom I love. My consolation
is that the Lord has you all under His care, and is carrying
on His work in the world by your means, and that when I
emerge I shall find that some progress is made in India
especially, the country I now regard as my own. Persia
is in many respects a ripe field for the harvest. Vast
numbers secretly hate and despise the superstition imposed
on them, and as many of them as have heard the Gospel
approve it, but they dare not hazard their lives for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
name of the Lord Jesus. I am sometimes asked whether
the external appearance of Mohammedanism might not be
retained with Christianity, and whether I could not baptize
them without their believing in the Divinity of Christ. I tell
them, No.</p>

<p>Though I have complained above of the inactivity of
my translation, I have reason to bless the Lord that He
thus supplies Gibeonites for the help of His true Israel.
They are employed in a work of the importance of which
they are unconscious, and are making provision for future
Persian saints, whose time is, I suppose, now near. Roll
back, ye crowded years, your thick array! Let the long,
long period of darkness and sin at last give way to the
brighter hours of light and liberty, which wait on the wings
of the Sun of Righteousness. Perhaps we witness the dawn
of the day of glory, and if not, the desire that we feel, that
Jesus may be glorified, and the nations acknowledge His
sway, is the earnest of the Spirit, that when He shall appear
we shall also appear with Him in glory. Kind love to all
the saints who are waiting His coming.</p>

</p>
<hr class="shorthr" />
<p>It is now determined that we leave Shiraz in a week,
and as the road through Persia is impassable through the
commotions which are always disturbing some part or other
of this unhappy country, I must go back to Bushire.</p>

<p>My scribe finished the New Testament; in correcting
we are no further than the 13th of Acts.</p>

<p><i>October 24</i> to <i>26</i>.&mdash;Resumed my Hebrew studies; on
the two first days translated the eight first Psalms into
Persian, the last all day long thinking about the word
Higgaion in the 9th Psalm.</p>

<p><i>October 27</i> to <i>29</i>.&mdash;Finished Psalm xii. Reading the
5th of St. Matthew to Zachariah my servant. Felt awfully
convinced of guilt; how fearlessly do I give way to cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>less
anger, speaking contemptuously of men, as if I had
never read this chapter. The Lord deliver me from all
my wickedness, and write His holy law upon my heart, that
I may walk circumspectly before Him all the remaining
days of my life.</p>

<p><i>November 1.</i>&mdash;Everything was prepared for our journey
to Baghdad by the Persian Gulf, and a large party of Shiraz
ladies, chiefly of Mirza Seid Ali&rsquo;s family, had determined
to accompany us, partly from a wish to visit the tombs,
and partly to have the company of their relations a little
longer. But a letter arriving with the intelligence that
Bagdhad was all in confusion, our kafila separated, and I
resolved to go on through Persia to Armenia, and so to
Syria. But the season was too far advanced for me to
think of traversing the regions of Caucasus just then, so I
made up my mind to winter at Shiraz.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="subheading">IN PERSIA&mdash;CONTROVERSIES WITH MOHAMMEDANS,
SOOFIS, AND JEWS</p>


<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s first week in Persia was enough to lead
him to use such language as this: &lsquo;If God rained down
fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah, how is it that this nation
is not blotted out from under heaven? I do not remember
to have heard such things of the Hindus, except the
Sikhs; they seem to rival the Mohammedans.&rsquo; The
experienced Bengal civilian, Mr. E. Scott Waring, had
thus summed up his impressions: &lsquo;The generality of
Persians are sunk in the lowest state of profligacy and
infamy, and they seldom hesitate alluding to crimes which
are abhorred and detested in every civilised country in the
universe. Their virtues consist in being most excellent
companions, and in saying this we say everything which
can be advanced in their favour. The same argument
cannot be advanced for them which has been urged in
favour of the Greeks, for they have laws which stigmatise
the crimes they commit.&rsquo; Every generation seems to have
departed farther and farther from the character of the hero-king,
Cyrus. At the present time, after two visits to
Europe by their Shah, the governing class, the priestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
order of Moojtahids, and the people seem to be more
hopelessly corrupt than ever.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>So early as the twelfth century the astronomer-poet of
Persia, Omar Khayyam, of Naishapur, in his few hundred
tetrastichs of exquisite verse which have ever since won
the admiration of the world, struck the note of dreary
scepticism and epicurean sensuality, as the Roman Lucretius
had done. His age was one of spiritual darkness,
when men felt their misery, and all the more that they saw
no means of relieving it. The purer creed of Zoroaster had
been stamped down but not rooted out by the illiterate
Arab hordes of Mohammed. A cultured Aryan race
could not accept submissively the ignorant fanaticism of
the Semitic sons of the desert. The Arabs destroyed or
drove out ultimately to India the fire-worshippers who
had courage to prefer their faith to the Koran; the mass
of the people and their leaders worked out the superficial
Mohammedanism identified with the name and the sufferings
of Ali. The new national religion became more and more
a falsehood, alike misrepresenting the moral facts and the
character and claims of God, and not really believed in by the
general conscience. The few who from time to time arose
endowed with spiritual fervour or poetic fire, found no vent
through the popular religion, and no satisfaction for the
aching void of the heart. The loftier natures ran by an
inevitable law of the human mind either into such self-indulgent
despairing scepticism as Omar Khayyam&rsquo;s, or
into the sensual mysticism of Sadi, Jami, and Hafiz, of the
whole tribe of ascetic enthusiasts and impostors, the Soofis,
fakeers, and durweshes, who fill the world of Islam, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the mosques on the Bosporus to the secret chambers of
Persia and Oudh. To all such we may use one of the few
rare tetrastichs which Omar Khayyam was compelled by
his higher nature to write:<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">O heart! wert thou pure from the body&rsquo;s dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Thou shouldest soar naked spirit above the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Highest heaven is thy native seat&mdash;for shame, for shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That thou shouldest stoop to dwell in a city of clay!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We must remember all this when we come to the disputations
of Henry Martyn with the doctors of Shiraz and
Persia. They, and some fifteen millions out of the hundred
and eighty millions of Islam in the world, are Shi&rsquo;ahs, or
&lsquo;followers&rsquo; of Ali, whom, as Mohammed&rsquo;s first cousin and
son-in-law, they accept as his first legitimate imam, kaliph,
or successor; while they treat the <i>de facto</i> kaliphs of the
Soonni Muslims&mdash;Abu Bakr, Omar, and Othman&mdash;as
usurpers. The Persians are in reality more tolerant of
the Christians, the Jews, and even the Majusi (Magi), or
fire-worshippers, all of whom are people of the Book who
have received an inspired revelation, than of their Soonni
co-religionists. The people&mdash;though not of course their
ruler, who is of Turkish origin&mdash;are more tolerant of new
sects, such as that of Babism, and even their spiritual
guides or the more respectable among these are in expectation
of a new leader, the twelfth, the Imam-al-Mahdi,
who has once before been manifested, and has long been
waiting secretly for the final consummation.</p>

<p>We must also realise the extent to which Soofi-ism
had saturated the upper classes and the Moojtahid order,
who sought out Henry Martyn, and even recognised in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
him the Divine drunkenness, so that they always treated
him and spoke of him as a <i>merdi khodai</i>, a man of God.
The first Soofi&mdash;a name taken either from the word for
the woollen dress of the Asiatic or from that for purity&mdash;was
Ali, according to the Shi&rsquo;ahs; but this form of
philosophical mysticism, often attended by carnal excesses
through which its devotees express themselves, is rather
Hindu in its origin. The deepest thought of the Asiatic,
without the revelation of Jesus Christ, is for Brahman and
Buddhist, Sikh and Soofi, Hindu and Mohammedan, this
absorption into the Divine Essence, so as to lose all personality
and individual consciousness. That Essence may
be the sum total of all things&mdash;the materialistic side; or
the spirit underlying matter, the idealistic side, but the loss
of individuality is the ultimate aim. But such absorption
can be finally reached only by works&mdash;asceticism,
pilgrimage, almsgiving, meditation&mdash;and by cycles of trans-migrations
to sublimate the soul for unconsciousness of all
that is objective, and of self itself. Hafiz is as full of wine
and women in his poems as Anacreon or the worst of the
Latin erotic poets; but the Soofis, who revel in his verses,
maintain that they &lsquo;profess eager desire with no carnal
affection, and circulate the cup, but no material goblet,
since all things are spiritual in their sect; all is mystery
within mystery.&rsquo;</p>

<p>What Henry Martyn learned to find, in even his brief
experience of the Aryan Shi&rsquo;ahs, to whom he offered the
love of Christ and through the Son a personal union with
the Father, is best expressed in this description by the
most recent skilled writer on the people, before referred to:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Persia is the one purely Mohammedan country which,
in the process of a national revolt against the rigid hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>-bound
orthodoxy of Islam, has only succeeded in wrapping
more closely round its national and political life the
encircling folds of that &lsquo;manteau commode, sous lequel
s&rsquo;abrite, en se cachant à peine, tout le passé.&rsquo; Under the
extravagances and fanaticism of the Shi&rsquo;ah heresy, the old
Zoroastrian faith lives on, transformed into an outward conformity
to the forms of the Moslem creed, and the product is
that grotesque confusion of faith and fanaticism, mysticism
and immorality, rationalism and superstition, which is the
despair and astonishment of all who have looked beneath
the surface of ordinary everyday life in Persia. Soofi-ism,
with its profound mysticism and godless doctrine, has
found a congenial home in Persia, often, indeed, blossoming
into beautiful literary form such as is found in the
<i>Rubaiyāt</i> of Omar Khayyam, or in the delightful pages of
the <i>Gulistan</i> of Sheikh Sadi, or in the poems of Hafiz.</p></div>

<p>Soofi-ism is the illegitimate offspring of scepticism and
fanaticism. It is tersely described by one Persian writer
as &lsquo;a sensual plunging into the abyss of darkness&rsquo;; by
another as &lsquo;a deadly abomination&rsquo;; and by a third as &lsquo;the
part of one who goes raving mad with unlawful lusts.&rsquo;
Nevertheless, as Professor Kuenen has well observed, the
true Soofi is a Moslem no more.</p>

<p>All Martyn&rsquo;s experience among the Wahabees of
Patna and the Shi&rsquo;ahs of Lucknow had fitted him for the
discussions which were almost forced upon him in Persia,
for he went there to translate the New Testament afresh.
But he had, in his reading, sought to prepare himself for
the Mohammedan controversy. When coasting round
India, he made this entry in his <i>Journal</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> &lsquo;<i>1811, January 28.</i>&mdash;Making
extracts from Maracci&rsquo;s <i>Refutation of Koran</i>.
Felt much false shame at being obliged to confess my
ignorance of many things which I ought to have known.&rsquo;
Soofi-ism met him the day after he reached Shiraz, on the
first visit of Seyd Ali, brother-in-law of his host, Jaffir Ali
Khan. Thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>June 10.</i>&mdash;He spoke so indistinctly, and with such
volubility, that I did not well comprehend him, but gathered
from his discourse that we are all parts of the Deity. I
observed that we had not these opinions in Europe, but
understood that they were parts of the Brahmanic system.
On my asking him for the foundation of his opinions, he
said the first argument he was prepared to bring forward
was this: God exists, man also exists, but existence is not
twofold, therefore God and man are of the same nature.
The minor I disputed: he defended it with many words.
I replied by objecting the consequences, Is there no
difference between right and wrong? There appeared a
difference, he said, to us, but before God it was nothing.
The waves of the sea are so many aspects and forms, but
it is still but one and the same water. In the outset he
spoke with great contempt of all revelation. &lsquo;You know,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;that in the law and Koran, etc., it is said, God
<i>created heaven</i> and the <i>earth</i>,&rsquo; etc. Reverting to this, I
asked whether these opinions were agreeable to what the
prophets had spoken. Perceiving me to be not quite philosophical
enough for him, he pretended some little reverence
for them, spoke of them as good men, etc., but added that
there was no evidence for their truth but what was
traditionary. I asked whether there was anything unreasonable
in God&rsquo;s making a revelation of His will. He
said, No. Whether a miracle for that purpose was not
necessary, at least useful, and therefore credible? He granted
it. Was not evidence from testimony rational evidence?
Yes. Have you then rational evidence for the religion of
Mohammed? He said the division of the moon was
generally brought forward, but he saw no sufficient
evidence for believing it; he mentioned the Koran with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
some hesitation, as if conscious that it would not stand as
a miracle. I said eloquence depended upon opinion; it
was no miracle for any but Arabs, and that some one
may yet rise up and write better. He allowed the force of
the objection, and said the Persians were very far from
thinking the eloquence of the Koran miraculous, however
the Arabs might think so. The last observation he made
was, that it was impossible not to think well of one by
whose example and instructions others had become great
and good; though therefore little was known of Mohammed,
he must have been something to have formed such men as
Ali. Here the conversation ceased. I told them in the
course of our conversation that, according to our histories,
the law and Gospel had been translated into Persian before
the time of Mohammed. He said they were not to be
found, because Omar in his ignorant zeal had probably
destroyed them. He spoke with great contempt of the
&lsquo;Arab asses.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>June 13.</i>&mdash;Seyd Ali breakfasted with us. Looking
at one of the plates in Hutton&rsquo;s <i>Mathematical Dictionary</i>,
where there was a figure of a fountain produced by the
rarefaction of the air, he inquired into the principle of it,
which I explained; he disputed the principle, and argued
for the exploded idea that nature abhors a vacuum. We
soon got upon religion again. I showed him some verses
in the Koran in which Mohammed disclaims the power of
working miracles. He could not reply. We talked again
on the evidence of testimony. The oldest book written by
a Mohammedan was the sermons of Ali. Allowing these
sermons to be really his, I objected to his testimony for
Mohammed, because he was interested in the support of that
religion. I asked him the meaning of a contested passage;
he gave the usual explanation; but as soon as the servants
were gone he turned round and said, &lsquo;It is only to make a
rhyme.&rsquo; This conversation seemed to be attended with
good. Our amiable host, Jaffir Ali, Mirza Jan, and Seyd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Ali seemed to be delighted with my arguments against
Mohammedanism, and did not at last evince a wish to defend
it. In the evening Jaffir Ali came and talked most
agreeably on religious subjects, respecting the obvious
tendency of piety and impiety, and the end to which they
would lead in a future world. One of his remarks was, &lsquo;If
I am in love with any one, I shall dream of her at night;
her image will meet me in my sleep. Now death is but a
sleep; if therefore I love God, or Christ, when I fall asleep
in death I shall meet Him, so also if I love Satan or his
works.&rsquo; He could wish, he said, if he had not a wife and
children, to go and live on the top of a mountain, so
disgusted was he with the world and its concerns. I
told him this was the first suggestion in the minds of
devotees in all religions, but that in reality it was not the
way to escape the pollution of the world, because a man&rsquo;s
wicked heart will go with him to the top of a mountain. It
is the grace of God changing the heart which will alone raise
us above the world. Christ commands His people to &lsquo;abide
in Him&rsquo;; this is the secret source of fruitfulness, without
which they are as branches cut off from the tree. He asked
whether there was no mention of a prophet&rsquo;s coming after
Christ. I said, No. &lsquo;Why then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;was any mention
made of Ahmed in the Koran?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;One day an
English gentleman said to me, &ldquo;I believe that Christ was
no better than myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are
worse than a Mohammedan.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>June 24.</i>&mdash;Went early this morning to the Jewish
synagogue with Jaffir Ali Khan. At the sight of a Mohammedan
of such rank, the chief person stopped the service
and came to the door to bring us in. He then showed us
the little room where the copies of the law were kept. He
said there were no old ones but at Baghdad and Jerusalem;
he had a printed copy with the Targum, printed at Leghorn.
The only European letters in it were the words
&lsquo;con approbazione,&rsquo; of which he was anxious to know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
meaning. The congregation consisted chiefly of little
boys, most of whom had the Psalter. I felt much distressed
that the worship of the God of Israel was not
there, and therefore I did not ask many questions. When
he found I could read Hebrew, he was very curious to
know who I might be, and asked my name. I told him
Abdool Museeh, in hopes that he would ask more, but he
did not, setting me down, I suppose, as a Mohammedan.</p>

<p><i>June 25.</i>&mdash;Every day I hear stories of these bloody
Tartars. They allow no Christian, not even a Soonni, to
enter their country, except in very particular cases, such
as merchants with a pass; but never allow one to return
to Persia if they catch him. They argue, &lsquo;If we suffer this
creature to go back, he will become the father of other
infidels, and thus infidelity will spread: so, for the sake of
God and His prophet, let us kill him.&rsquo; About 150 years
ago the men of Bokhara made an insidious attempt to
obtain a confession from the people of Mushed that they
were Shi&rsquo;ahs. Their moulvies begged to know what evidence
they had for the Khaliphat of Ali. But the men of
Mushed, aware of their purpose, said, &lsquo;We Shi&rsquo;ahs! no, we
acknowledge thee for friends.&rsquo; But the moollahs of Bokhara
were not satisfied with this confession, and three of them
deliberated together on what ought to be done. One said:
&lsquo;It is all hypocrisy; they must be killed.&rsquo; The other said:
&lsquo;No, if all be killed we shall kill some Soonnis.&rsquo; The third
said: &lsquo;If any can prove that their ancestors have ever been
Soonnis they shall be saved, but not else.&rsquo; Another
rejoined that, from being so long with Shi&rsquo;ahs, their faith
could not be pure, and so it was better to kill them. To
this another agreed, observing that though it was no sin
before men to let them live, he who spared them must be
answerable for it to God. When the three bloody inquisitors
had determined on the destruction of the Shi&rsquo;ah city,
they gave the signal, and 150,000 Tartars marched down
and put all to the sword.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p><i>June 26.</i>&mdash;We were to-day, according to our expectation,
just about setting off for Ispahan, when, Mirza
Ibrahim returning, gave us information that the Tartars
and Koords had made an irruption into Persia, and that
the whole Persian army was on its march to Kermanshah
to meet them. Thus our road is impassable. I wrote
instantly to the ambassador, to know what he would
advise, and the minister sent off an express with it. Mirza
Ibrahim, after reading my answer, had nothing to reply,
but made such a remark as I did not expect from a man of
his character, namely, that <i>he</i> was sufficiently satisfied the
Koran was a miracle, though he had failed to convince me.
Thus my labour is lost, except it be with the Lord. I
have now lost all hope of ever convincing Mohammedans by
argument. The most rational, learned, unprejudiced, charitable
men confessedly in the whole town cannot escape
from the delusion. I know not what to do but to pray for
them. I had some warm conversation with Seyd Ali on
his infidelity. I asked him what he wanted. Was there
any one thing on earth, of the same antiquity, as well
attested as the miracles, etc., of Christianity? He confessed
not, but he did not know the reason he could not believe:
perhaps it was levity and the love of the world, or the
power of Satan, but he had no faith at all. He could not
believe even in a future state. He asked at the end, &lsquo;Why
all this earnestness?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;For fear you should remain
in hell for ever.&rsquo; He was affected, and said no more.</p>

<p><i>June 27.</i>&mdash;The Prime Minister sent me, as a present,
four mules-load of melons from Kaziroon. Seyd Ali reading
the 2nd chapter of St. Matthew, where the star is said
to go before the wise men, asked: &lsquo;Then what do you say
to that, after what you were proving yesterday about the
stars?&rsquo; I said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> &lsquo;It was not necessary to suppose it was one
of those heavenly bodies; any meteor that had the appearance
of a star was sufficient for the purpose, and equally
miraculous.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then why call it a star?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because the magi
called it so, for this account was undoubtedly received
from them. Philosophers still talk of a falling star, though
every one knows that it is not a star.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>September 2</i> to <i>6</i>.&mdash;At Mirza Ibrahim&rsquo;s request we are
employed in making out a proof of the Divine mission of
Moses and Jesus. He fancies that my arguments against
Mohammedanism are equally applicable against these two,
and that as I triumphed when acting on the offensive, I
shall be as weak as he when I act on the defensive.</p>

<p><i>September 7</i> to <i>11</i>.&mdash;Employed much the same; daily
disputes with Jaffir Ali Khan about the Trinity; if they
may be called disputes in which I bring forward no arguments,
but calmly refer them to the Holy Scriptures. They
distress and perplex themselves without measure, and I
enjoy a peace, as respects these matters, which passeth
understanding. There is no passage that so frequently
occurs to me now as this: &lsquo;They shall be all taught of
God, and great shall be the peace of thy children.&rsquo; I have
this testimony that I have been taught of God.</p>

<p><i>1812, January 19.</i>&mdash;Aga Baba coming in while we were
translating, Mirza Seyd Ali told him he had been all the day
decrying the law. It is a favourite tenet of the Soofis,
that we should be subject to no law. Aga Baba said that
if Christ, while He removed the old law, had also forborne
to bring in His new way, He would have done still better.
I was surprised as well as shocked at such a remark from
him, but said nothing. The poor man, not knowing how to
exist without amusement, then turned to a game at chess.
How pitiable is the state of fallen man! Wretched, and
yet he will not listen to any proposals of relief: stupidly
ignorant, yet too wise to submit to learn anything from
God. I have often wondered to see how the merest dunce
thinks himself qualified to condemn and ridicule revealed
religion. These Soofis pretend too to be latitudinarians,
assigning idolaters the same rank as others in nearness to
God, yet they have all in their turn spoken contemptuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
of the Gospel. Perhaps because it is so decisively exclusive.
I begin now to have some notion of Soofi-ism. The
principle is this: Notwithstanding the good and evil,
pleasure and pain that is in the world, God is not affected
by it. He is perfectly happy with it all; if therefore we
can become like God we shall also be perfectly happy in
every possible condition. This, therefore, is salvation.</p>

<p><i>January 21.</i>&mdash;Aga Boozong, the most magisterial of
the Soofis, stayed most of the day with Mirza Seyd Ali
and Jaffir Ali Khan in my room. His speech as usual&mdash;all
things are only so many forms of God; paint as many
figures as you will on a wall, it is still but the same wall.
Tired of constantly hearing this same vapid truism, I asked
him, &lsquo;What then? With the reality of things we have
nothing to do, as we know nothing about them.&rsquo; These
forms, if he will have it that they are but forms, affect us
with pleasure and pain, just as if they were more real. He
said we were at present in a dream; in a dream we think
visionary things real&mdash;when we wake we discover the
delusion. I asked him how did he know but that this
dream might continue for ever. But he was not at all
disposed to answer objections, and was rather vexed at my
proposing them. So I let him alone to dissent as he
pleased. Mirza Seyd Ali read him some verses of St. Paul,
which he condescended to praise, but in such a way as to
be more offensive to me than if he had treated it with
contempt. He repeated again how much he was pleased
with the sentiments of Paul, as if his being pleased with
them would be a matter of exultation to me. He said they
were excellent precepts for the people of the world. The
parts Mirza Seyd Ali read were Titus iii. and Hebrews viii.
On the latter Mirza Seyd Ali observed that he (Paul) had
not written ill, but something like a good reasoner. Thus
they sit in judgment on God&rsquo;s Word, never dreaming that
they are to be judged by it. On the contrary, they regard
the best parts, as they call them, as approaching only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
towards the heights of Soofi-ism. Aga Boozong finally
observed that as for the Gospels he had not seen much in
them, but the Epistles he was persuaded would make the
book soon well known. There is another circumstance that
gained Paul importance in the eyes of Mirza Seyd Ali,
which is, that he speaks of Mark and Luke as his servants.</p>

<p><i>January 24.</i>&mdash;Found Seyd Ali rather serious this evening.
He said he did not know what to do to have his mind
made up about religion. Of all the religions Christ&rsquo;s was
the best, but whether to prefer this to Soofi-ism he could not
tell. In these doubts he was tossed to and fro, and is often
kept awake the whole night in tears. He and his brother
talk together on these things till they are almost crazed.
Before he was engaged in this work of translation, he says,
he used to read about two or three hours a day; now he
can do nothing else; has no inclination for anything else,
and feels unhappy if he does not correct his daily portion.
His late employment has given a new turn to his thoughts
as well as to those of his friends; they had not the most
distant conception of the contents of the New Testament.
He says his Soofi friends are exceedingly anxious to see the
Epistles, from the accounts he gives of them, and also he is
sure that almost the whole of Shiraz are so sensible of the
load of unmeaning ceremonies in which their religion consists,
that they will rejoice to see or hear of anything like
freedom, and that they would be more willing to embrace
Christ than the Soofis, who, after taking so much pains to be
independent of all law, would think it degrading to submit
themselves to any law again, however light.</p>

<p><i>February 4.</i>&mdash;Mirza Seyd Ali, who has been enjoying
himself in idleness and dissipation these two days instead
of translating, returned full of evil and opposition to the
Gospel. While translating 2 Peter iii., &lsquo;Scoffers ... saying,
Where is the promise of his coming?&rsquo; he began to ask
&lsquo;Well, they are in the right; where are any of His promises
fulfilled?&rsquo; I said the heathen nations have been given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Christ for an inheritance. He said No; it might be more
truly said that they are given to Mohammed, for what are
the Christian nations compared with Arabia, Persia, India,
Tartary, etc.? I set in opposition all Europe, Russia,
Armenia, and the Christians in the Mohammedan countries.
He added, at one time when the Abbasides carried their
arms to Spain, the Christian name was almost extinct. I
rejoined, however, that he was not yet come to the end of
things, that Mohammedanism was in itself rather a species of
heretical Christianity, for many professing Christians denied
the Divinity of our Lord, and treated the Atonement as a
fable. &lsquo;They do right,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;it is contrary to reason that
one person should be an atonement for all the rest. How
do you prove it? it is nowhere said in the Gospels. Christ
said He was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel.&rsquo; I urged the authority of the Apostles, founded
upon His word, &lsquo;Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on
earth,&rsquo; etc. &lsquo;Why, what are we to think of them,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;when we see Paul and Barnabas quarrelling; Peter acting
the hypocrite, sometimes eating with the Gentiles, and
then withdrawing from fear; and again, all the Apostles,
not knowing what to do about the circumcision of the
Gentiles, and disputing among themselves about it?&rsquo; I
answered, &lsquo;The infirmities of the Apostles have nothing to
do with their authority. It is not everything they do that
we are commanded to imitate, nor everything they might
say in private, if we knew it, that we are obliged to attend
to, but the commands they leave for the Church; and here
there is no difference among them. As for the discussions
about circumcision, it does not at all appear that the
Apostles themselves were divided in their opinions about it;
the difficulty seems to have been started by those believers
who had been Pharisees.&rsquo; &lsquo;Can you give me a proof,&rsquo; said
he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> &lsquo;of Christianity, that I may either believe, or be left
without excuse if I do not believe&mdash;a proof like that of one
of the theorems of Euclid?&rsquo; I said it is not to be
expected, but enough may be shown to leave every
man inexcusable. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;though this is only
probability, I shall be glad of that.&rsquo; &lsquo;As soon as our Testament
is finished,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;we will, if you please, set about
our third treatise, in which, if I fail to convince you, I can
at least state the reasons why I believed.&rsquo; &lsquo;You had better,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;begin with Soofi-ism, and show that that is absurd&rsquo;&mdash;meaning,
I suppose, that I should premise something
about the <i>necessity</i> of revelation. After a little pause, &lsquo;I
suppose,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you think it sinful to sport with the
characters of those holy men?&rsquo; I said I had no objection
to hear all their objections and sentiments, but I could
not bear anything spoken disrespectfully of the Lord
Jesus; &lsquo;and yet there is not one of your Soofis,&rsquo; I added,
&lsquo;but has said something against Him. Even your master,
Mirza Abul Kasim, though he knows nothing of the Gospel
or law, and has not even seen them, presumed to say that
Moses, Christ, Mohammed, etc., were all alike. I did not
act in this way. In India I made every inquiry,
both about Hinduism and Mohammedanism. I read
the Koran through twice. On my first arrival here I
made it my business to ask for your proofs, so that if I
condemned and rejected it, it was not without consideration.
Your master, therefore, spoke rather precipitately.&rsquo; He did
not attempt to defend him, but said, &lsquo;You never heard <i>me</i>
speak lightly of Jesus.&rsquo; &lsquo;No; there is something so awfully
pure about Him that nothing is to be said.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>March 18.</i>&mdash;Sat a good part of the day with Abul Kasim,
the Soofi sage, Mirza Seyd Ali, and Aga Mohammed
Hasan, who begins to be a disciple of the old man&rsquo;s. On
my expressing a wish to see the Indian book, it was proposed
to send for it, which they did, and then read it aloud.
The stoicism of it I controverted, and said that the entire
annihilation of the passions, which the stupid Brahman
described as perfection, was absurd. On my continuing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
treat other parts of the book with contempt, the old man
was a little roused, and said that this was the way that
pleased them, and my way pleased me. That thus God
provided something for the tastes of all, and as the master
of a feast provides a great variety, some eat <i>pilao</i>, others
prefer <i>kubab</i>, etc. On my again remarking afterwards
how useless all these descriptions of perfection were, since
no rules were given for attaining it, the old man asked what
in my opinion was the way. I said we all agreed in one
point, namely, that union with God was perfection; that
in order to that we must receive the Spirit of God, which
Spirit was promised on condition of believing in Jesus.
There was a good deal of disputing about Jesus, His being
exclusively the visible God. Nothing came of it apparently,
but that Mirza Seyd Ali afterwards said, &lsquo;There is
no getting at anything like truth or certainty. We know
nothing at all; you are in the right, who simply believe
because Jesus had said so.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>March 22.</i>&mdash;These two days I have been thinking from
morning to night about the Incarnation; considering if I
could represent it in such a way as to obviate in any degree
the prejudices of the Mohammedans; not that I wished to
make it appear altogether agreeable to reason, but I wanted
to give a consistent account of the nature and uses of this
doctrine, as they are found in the different parts of the
Holy Scriptures. One thing implied another to such an
extent that I thought necessarily of the nature of life, death,
spirit, soul, animal nature, state of separate spirits, personality,
the person of Christ, etc., that I was quite worn out
with fruitless thought. Towards evening Carapiet with
another Armenian came and conversed on several points
of theology, such as whether the fire of hell were literally
fire or only remorse, whether the Spirit proceeded from the
Father and the Son, or from the Father only, and how we
are to reconcile those two texts, that &lsquo;for every idle word
that men shall speak,&rsquo; etc., with the promises of salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
through faith? Happening to speak in praise of some
person who practised needless austerities, I tried to make
him understand that this was not the way of the Gospel.
He urged these texts&mdash;&lsquo;Blessed are they that mourn,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Blessed are ye that weep now,&rsquo; etc. While we were discussing
this point, Mohammed Jaffir, who on a former
occasion had conversed with me a good deal about the
Gospel, came in. I told him the question before us was an
important one, namely, how the love of sin was to be got
out of the heart. The Armenian proceeded, &lsquo;If I wish to
go to a dancing or drinking, I must deny myself.&rsquo; Whether
he meant to say that this was sufficient I do not know,
but the Mohammedan understanding him so, replied that he
had read yesterday in the Gospel, &lsquo;that whosoever looketh
upon a woman,&rsquo; etc., from which he inferred that obedience
of the heart was requisite. This he expressed with such
propriety and gracefulness, that, added to the circumstance
of his having been reading the Gospel, I was quite delighted,
and thought with pleasure of the day when the Gospel
should be preached by Persians. After the Armenians
were gone we considered the doctrines of the Soofis a
little. Finding me not much averse to what he thought
some of their most exceptionable tenets, such as union with
God, he brought this argument: &lsquo;You will allow that God
cannot bind, compel, command Himself.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, He cannot.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, if we are one with God, we cannot be subject to any
of His laws.&rsquo; I replied: &lsquo;Our union with God is such an
union as exists between the members of a body. Notwithstanding
the union of the hand with the heart and head, it
is still subject to the influence and control of the ruling
power in the person.&rsquo; We had a great deal of conversation
afterwards on the Incarnation. All his Mohammedan prejudices
revolted. &lsquo;Sir, what do you talk of? the self-existent
become contained in space, and suffer need!&rsquo; I
told him that it was the manhood of Christ that suffered
need, and as for the essence of the Deity, if he would tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
me anything about it, where or how it was, I would tell
him how the Godhead was in Christ. After an effort or
two he found that every term he used implied our frightful
doctrine, namely, personality, locality, etc. This is a
thought that is now much in my mind&mdash;that it is so ordered
that, since men never can speak of God but through the
medium of language, which is all material, nor think of God
but through the medium of material objects, they do unwillingly
come to God through the Word, and think of God
by means of an Incarnation.</p>

<p><i>March 28.</i>&mdash;The same person came again, and we talked
incessantly for four hours upon the evidences of the two
religions, the Trinity, Incarnation, etc., until I was quite
exhausted, and felt the pain in my breast which I used to
have in India.</p>

<p><i>April 7.</i>&mdash;Observing a party of ten or a dozen poor
Jews with their priest in the garden, I attacked them, and
disputed a little with the Levite on Psalms ii., xvi. and xxiv.
They were utterly unacquainted with Jesus, and were surprised
at what I told them of His Resurrection and Ascension.
The priest abruptly broke off the conversation, told
me he would call and talk with me in my room, and carried
away his flock. Reading afterwards the story of Joseph
and his brethren, I was much struck with the exact correspondence
between the type and antitype. Jesus will at
last make Himself known to His brethren, and then they
will find that they have been unknowingly worshipping Him
while worshipping the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel.</p>

<p><i>April 8.</i>&mdash;The Prince dining to-day at a house on the
side of a hill, which commands a view of the town, issued
an order for all the inhabitants to exhibit fireworks for his
amusement, or at least to make bonfires on the roofs of
their houses, under penalty of five tomans in case of neglect.
Accordingly fire was flaming in all directions, enough to
have laid any city in Europe in ashes. One man fell off a
roof and was killed, and two others in the same way were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
so hurt that their lives were despaired of, and a woman
lost an eye by the stick of a sky-rocket.</p>

<p><i>July 9.</i>&mdash;Made an extraordinary effort, and as a Tartar
was going off instantly to Constantinople, wrote letters
to Mr. Grant for permission to come to England, and to Mr.
Simeon and Lydia, informing them of it; but I have
scarcely the remotest expectation of seeing it, except by
looking at the Almighty power of God.</p>

<p>Dined at night at the ambassador&rsquo;s, who said he was
determined to give every possible <i>éclat</i> to my book, by
presenting it himself to the King. My fever never ceased
to rage till the 21st, during all which time every effort was
made to subdue it, till I had lost all my strength and
almost all my reason. They now administer bark, and it
may please God to bless the tonics; but I seem too far
gone, and can only say, &lsquo;Having a desire to depart and be
with Christ, which is far better.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Rev. D. Corrie</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
Shiraz: September 12, 1811.<br />
</p>

<p>Dearest Brother,&mdash;I can hardly conceive, or at least am
not willing to believe, that you would forget me six successive
months; I conclude, therefore, that you must have
written, though I have not seen your handwriting since I
left Calcutta.</p>

<p>The Persian translation goes on but slowly. I and my
translator have been engaged in a controversy with his
uncle, which has left us little leisure for anything else. As
there is nothing at all in this dull place to take the attention
of the people, no trade, manufactures, or news, every event
at all novel is interesting to them. You may conceive,
therefore, what a strong sensation was produced by the
stab I aimed at the vitals of Mohammed. Before five
people had seen what I wrote, defences of Islam swarmed
into ephemeral being from all the moulvi maggots of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
place, but the more judicious men were ashamed to let
me see them. One moollah, called Aga Akbar, was determined
to distinguish himself. He wrote with great acrimony
on the margin of my pamphlet, but passion had
blinded his reason, so that he smote the wind. One day
I was on a visit of ceremony to the Prime Minister, and
sitting in great state by his side, fifty visitors in the same
hall, and five hundred clients without, when who should
make his appearance but my tetric adversary, the said
Aga Akbar, who came for the express purpose of presenting
the Minister with a piece he had composed in defence of
the prophet, and then sitting down told me he should
present me with a copy that day. &lsquo;There are four answers,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;to your objection against his using the sword.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I shall be glad to see them, though I
made no such objection.&rsquo; Eager to display his attainments
in all branches of science, he proceeded to call in question
the truth of our European philosophy, and commanded
me to show that the earth moved, and not the sun. I told
him that in matters of religion, where the salvation of men
was concerned, I would give up nothing to them, but as
for points in philosophy they might have it all their own
way. This was not what he wanted; so after looking at
the Minister, to know if it was not a breach of good manners
to dispute at such a time, and finding that there was
nothing contrary to custom, but that, on the contrary, he
rather expected an answer, I began, but soon found that
he could comprehend nothing without diagrams. A
moonshi in waiting was ordered to produce his implements,
so there was I, drawing figures, while hundreds of
men were looking on in silence.</p>

<p>But all my trouble was in vain&mdash;the moollah knew
nothing whatever of mathematics, and therefore could not
understand my proofs. The Persians are far more curious
and clever than the Indians. Wherever I go they ask me
questions in philosophy, and are astonished that I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
know everything. One asked me the reason of the properties
of the magnet. I told him I knew nothing about it.
&lsquo;But what do your learned men say?&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>They</i> know nothing
about it.&rsquo; This he did not at all credit.</p>

<p>I do not find myself improving in Persian; indeed, I
take no pains to speak it well, not perceiving it to be of
much consequence. India is the land where we can act
at present with most effect. It is true that the Persians
are more susceptible, but the terrors of an inquisition are
always hanging over them. I can now conceive no greater
happiness than to be settled for life in India, superintending
native schools, as we did at Patna and Chunar. To preach
so as to be readily understood by the poor is a difficulty
that appears to me almost insuperable, besides that grown-up
people are seldom converted. However, why should
we despair? If I live to see India again, I shall set to
and learn Hindi in order to preach. The day may come
when even our word may be with the Holy Ghost and
with power. It is now almost a year since I left Cawnpore,
and my journey is but beginning: when shall I ever get
back again? I am often tempted to get away from this
prison, but again I recollect that some years hence I shall
say: &lsquo;When I was at Shiraz why did not I get the New
Testament done? What difference would a few months
have made?&rsquo; In August I passed some days at a vineyard,
about a parasang from the city, where my host pitched a
tent for me, but it was so cold at night that I was glad to
get back to the city again. Though I occupy a room in
his house, I provide for myself. Victuals are cheap enough,
especially fruit; the grapes, pears, and water-melons are
delicious; indeed, such a country for fruit I had no conception
of. I have a fine horse which I bought for less
than a hundred rupees, on which I ride every morning
round the walls. My vain servant, Zechariah, anxious
that his master should appear like an ameer, furnished
him (<i>i.e.</i> the horse) with a saddle, or rather a pillion, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
fairly covers his whole back; it has all the colours of the
rainbow, but yellow is predominant, and from it hang down
four large tassels, also yellow. But all my finery does not
defend me from the boys. Some cry out, &lsquo;Ho, Russ!&rsquo;
others cry out, &lsquo;Feringhi!&rsquo; One day a brickbat was flung
at me, and hit me in the hip with such force that I felt it
quite a providential escape. Most of the day I am about
the translation, sometimes, at a leisure hour, trying at
Isaiah, in order to get help from the Persian Jews. My
Hebrew reveries have quite disappeared, merely for want
of leisure. I forgot to say that I have been to visit the
ruins of Persepolis, but this, with many other things, must
be reserved for a hot afternoon at Cawnpore.</p>

<p>What would I give for a few lines from you, to say
how the men come on, and whether their numbers are increasing,
whether you meet the Sherwoods at the evening
repast, as when I was there! My kindest love to them,
your sister, and all that love us in the truth. May the
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, and
with your faithful and affectionate brother,</p>

<span class="smcap">H. Martyn.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>The Secretary to the British Embassy to Persia, and
afterwards himself Minister Plenipotentiary to its Court,
Mr. James Morier, has given us a notable sketch of Henry
Martyn as a controversialist for Christ, and of the impression
that he made on the officials, priests, and people of all
classes. As the author of the <i>Adventures of Hajji Baba
of Ispahan</i> and other life-like tales of the East, and as an
accomplished traveller, the father of the present Ambassador
to St. Petersburg is the first authority on such a subject.
In his <i>Second Journey through Persia, Armenia, and Asia
Minor to Constantinople</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> he thus writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>The Persians, who were struck with his humility, his
patience and resignation, called him a <i>merdi khodai</i>, a
man of God, and indeed every action of his life seemed to
be bent towards the one object of advancing the interest
of the Christian religion. When he was living at Shiraz,
employed in his translation, he neither sought nor shunned
the society of the natives, many of whom constantly drew
him into arguments about religion, with the intention of
persuading him of the truth and excellence of theirs. His
answers were such as to stimulate them to further arguments,
and in spite of their pride the principal moollahs,
who had heard of his reputation, paid him the first visit,
and endeavoured in every way to entangle him in his talk.
At length he thought that the best mode of silencing them
was by writing a reply to the arguments which they
brought against our belief and in favour of their own. His
tract was circulated through different parts of Persia, and
was sent from hand to hand to be answered. At length it
made its way to the King&rsquo;s court, and a moollah of high
consideration, who resided at Hamadan, and who was
esteemed one of the best controversialists in the country,
was ordered to answer it. After the lapse of more than a
year he did answer it, but such were the strong positions
taken by Mr. Martyn that the Persians themselves were
ashamed of the futility of their own attempts to break
them down: for, after they had sent their answer to the
ambassador, they requested that it might be returned to
them again, as another answer was preparing to be given.
Such answer has never yet been given; and we may infer
from this circumstance that if, in addition to the Scriptures,
some plain treatises of the evidences of Christianity, accompanied
by strictures upon the falseness of the doctrines
of Mohammed, were translated into Persian and disseminated
throughout that country, very favourable effects
would be produced. Mr. Martyn caused a copy of his
translation to be beautifully written, and to be presented
by the ambassador to the King, who was pleased to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
it very graciously. A copy of it was made by Mirza
Baba, a Persian who gave us lessons in the Persian
language, and he said that many of his countrymen asked
his permission to take Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s translation to their
homes, where they kept it for several days, and expressed
themselves much edified by its contents. But whilst he was
employed in copying it, moollahs (the Persian scribes) used
frequently to sit with him and revile him for undertaking
such a work. On reading the passage where our Saviour
is called &lsquo;the Lamb of God,&rsquo; they scorned and ridiculed
the simile, as if exulting in the superior designation of
Ali, who is called <i>Sheer</i> Khodai, the Lion of God. Mirza
Baba observed to them: &lsquo;The lion is an unclean beast; it
preys upon carcases, and you are not allowed to wear its
skin because it is impure; it is destructive, fierce, and
man&rsquo;s enemy. The lamb, on the contrary, is in every way
<i>halal</i> or lawful. You eat its flesh, you wear its skin on
your head, it does no harm, and is an animal beloved.
Whether is it best, then, to say the Lamb of God, or the
Lion of God?&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn had not been two months in Shiraz
when, as his attendant expressed it, he became the town-talk.
The populace believed that he had come to declare
himself a Mussulman, and would then bring five thousand
men to the city and take possession of it. Dissatisfied
with their own government, many Mohammedans began
to desire English rule, such as was making India peaceful
and prosperous, and as was supposed to enrich all who
enjoyed it. Jewish perverts to Islam crowded to the garden,
where at all times, even on Sunday, the saintly visitor was
accessible. Armenians spoke to him with a freedom they
dared not show in conversation with others. From Baghdad
to Busrah, and from Bushire to Ispahan and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Etchmiatzin, visitors crowded to talk with the wonderful
scholar and holy man. Thus on July 6 he was presented
by Sir Gore Ouseley to the Governor, Prince Abbas Mirza.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Early this morning I went with the ambassador and
his suite to court, wearing, agreeably to custom, a pair of
red cloth stockings, with green high-heeled shoes. When
we entered the great court of the palace a hundred
fountains began to play. The prince appeared at the
opposite side, in his talar, or hall of audience, seated on
the ground. Here our first bow was made. When we
came in sight of him we bowed a second time, and entered
the room. He did not rise, nor take notice of any but the
ambassador, with whom he conversed at the distance of
the breadth of the room. Two of his ministers stood in
front of the hall outside; the ambassador&rsquo;s mihmander,
and the master of the ceremonies, within at the door.
We sat down in order, in a line with the ambassador,
with our hats on. I never saw a more sweet and engaging
countenance than the prince&rsquo;s; there was such an appearance
of good nature and humility in all his demeanour,
that I could scarcely bring myself to believe that he would
be guilty of anything cruel or tyrannical.</p>

<p>Mahommed Shareef Khan, one of the most renowned
of the Persian generals, having served the present royal
family for four generations, called to see me, out of respect
to General Malcolm. An Armenian priest also, on his
way from Busrah to Ispahan; he was as ignorant as the
rest of his brethren. To my surprise I found that he was
of the Latin Church, and read the service in Latin, though
he confessed he knew nothing about the language.</p></div>

<p>The first of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s public controversies with
the Shi&rsquo;ah doctors, as distinguished from the almost daily
discussions already described in his <i>Journal</i>, took place
in the house of the Moojtahid of Shiraz on July 15, 1811.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
The doctrine of Jesus, represented by such a follower, was
beginning so to tell on Shi&rsquo;ahs and Soofis, ever eager for
something new, that the interference of the first authority
of Islam in all Persia became necessary. Higher than all
other Mohammedan divines, especially among the Shi&rsquo;ahs,
are the three or four Moojtahids.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> They must be saintly,
learned, and aloof from worldly ambition. In Persia each
acts as an informal and final court of appeal; he alone dares
to temper the tyranny of the Shah by his influence; his
house is a sanctuary for the oppressed; the city of his
habitation is often saved from violence by his presence.
This was the position and the pretension of the man who,
having first ascertained that the English man of God did
not want demonstration, but admitted that the prophets
had been sent, invited him to dinner, preliminary to a conflict.
Martyn has left this description of the scene:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>About eight o&rsquo;clock at night we went, and after passing
along many an avenue we entered a fine court, where was
a pond, and, by the side of it, a platform eight feet high,
covered with carpets. Here sat the Moojtahid in state,
with a considerable number of his learned friends&mdash;among
the rest, I perceived the Jew. One was at his prayers. I
was never more disgusted at the mockery of this kind of
prayer. He went through the evolutions with great exactness,
and pretended to be unmoved at the noise and
chit-chat of persons on each side of him. The Professor
seated Seyd Ali on his right hand, and me on his left.
Everything around bore the appearance of opulence and
ease, and the swarthy obesity of the little personage
himself led me to suppose that he had paid more attention
to cooking than to science. But when he began to speak,
I saw reason enough for his being so much admired. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
substance of his speech was flimsy enough; but he spoke
with uncommon fluency and clearness, and with a manner
confident and imposing. He talked for a full hour about
the soul; its being distinct from the body; superior to the
brutes, etc.; about God; His unity, invisibility, and other
obvious and acknowledged truths. After this followed
another discourse. At length, after clearing his way for
miles around, he said that philosophers had proved that a
single being could produce but a single being; that the
first thing God had created was <i>Wisdom</i>, a being perfectly
one with Him; after that, the souls of men, and the seventh
heaven; and so on till He produced matter, which is
merely passive. He illustrated the theory by comparing
all being to a circle; at one extremity of the diameter is
God, at the opposite extremity of the diameter is matter,
than which nothing in the world is meaner. Rising from
thence, the highest stage of matter is connected with the
lowest stage of vegetation; the highest of the vegetable
world with the lowest of the animal; and so on, till we
approach the point from which all proceeded. &lsquo;But,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;you will observe that, next to God, something
ought to be which is equal to God; for since it is equally
near, it possesses equal dignity. What this is philosophers
are not agreed upon. You,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;say it is Christ; but
we, that it is the Spirit of the Prophets. All this is what
the philosophers have proved, independently of any particular
religion.&rsquo; I rather imagined that it was the invention
of some ancient Oriental Christian, to make the doctrine
of the Trinity appear more reasonable. There were a
hundred things in the Professor&rsquo;s harangue that might have
been excepted against, as mere dreams, supported by no
evidence; but I had no inclination to call in question
dogmas on the truth or falsehood of which nothing in
religion depended.</p>

<p>He was speaking at one time about the angels, and
asserted that man was superior to them, and that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
being greater than man could be created. Here the Jew
reminded me of a passage in the Bible, quoting something
in Hebrew. I was a little surprised, and was just about to
ask where he found anything in the Bible to support such
a doctrine, when the Moojtahid, not thinking it worth
while to pay any attention to what the Jew said, continued
his discourse. At last the Jew grew impatient, and finding
an opportunity of speaking, said to me, &lsquo;Why do not you
speak? Why do not you bring forward your objections?&rsquo;
The Professor, at the close of one of his long speeches, said
to me, &lsquo;You see how much there is to be said on these
subjects; several visits will be necessary; we must come
to the point by degrees.&rsquo; Perceiving how much he dreaded
a close discussion, I did not mean to hurry him, but let
him talk on, not expecting we should have anything about
Muhammadanism the first night. But, at the instigation
of the Jew, I said, &lsquo;Sir, you see that Abdoolghunee is
anxious that you should say something about Islam.&rsquo; He
was much displeased at being brought so prematurely to
the weak point, but could not decline accepting so direct a
challenge. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he to me, &lsquo;I must ask you a few
questions. Why do you believe in Christ?&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;That is not the question. I am at liberty to say that I
do not believe in any religion; that I am a plain man
seeking the way of salvation; that it was, moreover, quite
unnecessary to prove the truth of Christ to Muhammadans,
because they allowed it.&rsquo; &lsquo;No such thing,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;the
Jesus we acknowledge is He who was a prophet, a mere
servant of God, and one who bore testimony to Muhammad;
not your Jesus, whom you call God,&rsquo; said he, with a contemptuous
smile. He then enumerated the persons who
had spoken of the miracles of Muhammad, and told a long
story about Salmon the Persian, who had come to
Muhammad. I asked whether this Salmon had written
an account of the miracles he had seen. He confessed
that he had not. &lsquo;Nor,&rsquo; said I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> &lsquo;have you a single witness
to the miracles of Muhammad.&rsquo; He then tried to show
that, though they had not, there was still sufficient evidence.
&lsquo;For,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;suppose five hundred persons should say
that they heard some particular thing of a hundred persons
who were with Muhammad, would that be sufficient evidence
or not?&rsquo; &lsquo;Whether it be or not,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you have
no such evidence as that, nor anything like it; but if you
have, as they are something like witnesses, we must proceed
to examine them and see whether their testimony deserves
credit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After this the Koran was mentioned; but as the company
began to thin, and the great man had not a sufficient
audience before whom to display his eloquence, the dispute
was not so brisk. He did not indeed seem to think it
worth while to notice my objections. He mentioned a
well-known sentence in the Koran as being inimitable. I
produced another sentence, and begged to know why it
was inferior to the Koranic one. He declined saying why,
under pretence that it required such a knowledge of rhetoric
in order to understand his proofs as I probably did not
possess. A scholar afterwards came to Seyd Ali, with
twenty reasons for preferring Muhammad&rsquo;s sentence to
mine.</p>

<p>It was midnight when dinner, or rather supper, was
brought in: it was a sullen meal. The great man was
silent, and I was sleepy. Seyd Ali, however, had not had
enough. While burying his hand in the dish of the Professor,
he softly mentioned some more of my objections.
He was so vexed that he scarcely answered anything; but
after supper told a very long story, all reflecting upon me.
He described a grand assembly of Christians, Jews, Guebres,
and Sabeans (for they generally do us the honour of
stringing us with the other three), before Imam Ruza. The
Christians were of course defeated and silenced. It was a
remark of the Imam&rsquo;s, in which the Professor acquiesced,
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> &lsquo;it is quite useless for Muhammadans and Christians
to argue together, as they had different languages and
different histories.&rsquo; To the last I said nothing; but to the
former replied by relating the fable of the lion and man,
which amused Seyd Ali so much that he laughed out
before the great man, and all the way home.</p></div>

<p>The intervention of the Moojtahid only added to the sensation
excited among all classes by the saintly Feringhi.
The Shi&rsquo;ah doctors had their second corrective almost
ready. They resolved to check the spirit of inquiry by
issuing, eleven days after the Moojtahid&rsquo;s attempt, a defence
of Muhammadanism by Mirza Ibrahim, described as &lsquo;the
preceptor of all the moollas.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The event has an interest of
its own, apart from Henry Martyn, in the light of a famous
controversy which preceded it, and of spiritually fruitful
discussions which followed it, all in India. Before Henry
Martyn in this field of Christian apologetic was the Portuguese
Jesuit, Hieronymo Xavier, and after him were the
Scots missionary, John Wilson of Bombay, and the German
agent of the Church Missionary Society, C.G. Pfander.</p>

<p>Among the representatives of all religions whom the
tolerant Akbar invited to his court at Agra, that out of
their teaching he might form an eclectic cult of his own,
was Jerome, the nephew of the famous Francis Xavier, then
at Goa. For Akbar P. Hieronymo Xavier wrote in Persian
two histories, <i>Christi</i> and <i>S. Petri</i>. To his successor, the
Emperor Jahangir, in whose suite he was the first European
who visited Kashmir, H. Xavier in the year 1609 dedicated
his third Persian book, entitled <i>A Mirror showing the Truth</i>,
in which the doctrines of the Christian religion are discussed,
the mysteries of the Gospel explained, and the vanity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
(all) other religions is to be seen. He has been pronounced
by a good authority<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> a man of considerable ability and
energy, but one who trusted more to his own ingenuity
than to the plain and unsophisticated declarations of the
Holy Scriptures. Ludovicus de Dieu, the Dutch scholar,
who translated his two first works into Latin, most fairly
describes each on the title-page as &lsquo;multis modis contaminata.&rsquo;
Twelve years after, to the third or controversial
treatise of P.H. Xavier an answer was published by &lsquo;the
most mean of those who stand in need of the mercy of a
bounteous God, Ahmed ibn Zaín Elábidín Elálooi,&rsquo; under
a title thus translated, <i>The Divine Rays in refutation of
Christian Error</i>. To this a rejoinder in Latin appeared at
Rome in 1631, from the pen of Philip Guadagnoli, Arabic
Professor in the Propaganda College there. He calls it
<i>Apologia pro Christiana Religione</i>. If we except Raimund
Lull&rsquo;s two spiritual treatises and <i>Ars Major</i>, and Pocock&rsquo;s
Arabic translation of the <i>De Veritate Religionis Christianæ</i>,
which Grotius wrote as a text-book for the Dutch
missionaries in the East Indies, Henry Martyn&rsquo;s was the
first attempt of Reformed Christendom to carry the
pure doctrine of Jesus Christ to the Asiatic races whom the
corruptions of Judaism and the Eastern Churches had
blinded into accepting the Koran and all its consequences.</p>

<p>Mirza Ibrahim&rsquo;s Arabic challenge to the Christian
scholar is pronounced by so competent and fair an
authority as Sir William Muir<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> as made by a man of talent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
and acuteness, and remarkable for its freedom from violent
and virulent remarks.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This argument chiefly concerns the subject of miracles,
which he accommodates to the Koran. He defines a
miracle as an effect exceeding common experience, accompanied
by a prophetic claim and a challenge to produce
the like; and he holds that it may be produced by particular
experience&mdash;that is, it may be confined to any single
art, but must be attested by the evidence and confession of
those best skilled in that art. Thus he assumes the miracles
of Moses and Jesus to belong respectively to the arts of
magic and physic, which had severally reached perfection
in the times of these prophets; the evidence of the
magicians is hence deemed sufficient for the miracles of
Moses, and that of the physicians for those of Jesus; but
had these miracles occurred in any other age than that in
which those arts flourished, their proof would have been
imperfect, and the miracles consequently not binding.
This extraordinary doctrine&mdash;which Henry Martyn shows
to be founded upon an inadequate knowledge of history&mdash;he
proceeds to apply to the Koran, and proves entirely to his
own satisfaction that it fulfils all the required conditions.
This miracle belonged to the science of eloquence, and in
that science the Arabs were perfect adepts. The Koran
was accompanied by a challenge, and when they accordingly
professed their inability to produce an equal, their evidence,
like that of the magicians&rsquo; and physicians&rsquo;, became universally
binding. He likewise dilates upon the superior and
perpetual nature of the Koran as an intellectual and a
<i>lasting</i> miracle, which will remain unaltered when all others
are forgotten. He touches slightly on Mohammed&rsquo;s other
miracles, and asserts the insufficiency of proof (except
through the Koran) for those of all former prophets.</p></div>

<p>To this, which was accompanied by a treatise on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
miracles of Mohammed by Aga Akbar, Henry Martyn
wrote a reply in three parts. In what spirit he conducted
the controversy, and what influence through him the Spirit
of Christ had on some of the Shi&rsquo;ahs and Soofis, this
extract from his <i>Journal</i> unconsciously testifies:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1811, September 12</i> to <i>15</i>. (Sunday.)&mdash;Finished what I
had to say on the evidences of religion, and translated it
into Persian. Aga Akbar sent me his treatise by one of
his disciples. Aga Baba, his brother, but a very different
person from him, called; he spoke without disguise of his
dislike to Mohammedanism and good-will to Christianity.
For his attachment to Mirza Abel, Kasim, his brother,
sets him down as an infidel. Mirza Ibrahim is still in
doubt, and thinks that he may be a Christian, and be
saved without renouncing Mohammedanism; asks his
nephew what is requisite to observe; he said, Baptism
and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what harm is there
in doing that?&rsquo; At another time Seyd Ali asked me, after
a dispute, whether I would baptize any one who did not
believe in the Divinity of Christ? I said, No. While
translating Acts ii. and iii., especially where it is said all
who believed had one heart and one mind, and had all
things in common, he was much affected, and contrasted
the beginning of Christianity with that of Mohammedanism,
where they began their career with murdering men and
robbing caravans; and oh, said he, &lsquo;that I were sure the
Holy Spirit would be given to me! I would become a
Christian at once.&rsquo; Alas! both his faith and mine are very
weak. Even if he were to desire baptism I should tremble
to give it. He spake in a very pleasing way on other
parts of the Gospel, and seems to have been particularly
taken with the idea of a new birth. The state of a
new-born child gives him the most striking view of that
simplicity which he considers as the height of wisdom.
Simplicity is that to which he aspires, he says, above all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
things. He was once proud of his knowledge, and vain
of his superiority to others, but he found that fancied
knowledge set him at a greater distance from happiness than
anything else.</p></div>

<p>Martyn&rsquo;s first reply in Persian to Mirza Ibrahim thus
begins: &lsquo;The Christian Minister thanks the celebrated Professor
of Islamism for the favour he has done him in writing
an answer to his inquiries, but confesses that, after reading it,
a few doubts occurred to him, on account of which, and not
for the mere purpose of dispute, he has taken upon himself
to write the following pages.&rsquo; The reply is signed, &lsquo;The
Christian Minister, Henry Martyn.&rsquo; One Mirza Mahommed
Ruza published in 1813, the year after Martyn&rsquo;s death, a
very prolix rejoinder. It is unworthy of lengthened notice,
according to Sir William Muir, who thus summarises and
comments on the defence made by the Christian scholar:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s first tract refers chiefly to the subject
of miracles: he asserts that, to be conclusive, a miracle
must exceed <i>universal</i> experience; that the testimony and
opinion of the Arabs is therefore insufficient, besides being
that of a party concerned; that, were the Koran allowed
to be inimitable, that would not prove it to be a miracle;
and that its being an <i>intellectual</i> miracle is not a virtue,
but, by making it generally inappreciable, a defect. He
concludes by denying the proof of Mohammed&rsquo;s other
miracles, in which two requisites are wanting: viz., their
being recorded at or near the time of their occurrence, and
the narrators being under no constraint.</p>

<p>The second tract directly attacks Mohammed&rsquo;s mission,
by alleging the debasing nature of some of the contents
and precepts of the Koran, holds good works and repentance
to be insufficient for salvation, and opens the subject
of the true atonement as prefigured in types, fulfilled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Christ, and made public by the spread of Christianity
which is mentioned as itself a convincing miracle.</p>

<p>The last tract commences with an attack on the
absurdities of Soofi-ism, and proceeds to show that the
love of God and union with Him cannot be obtained by
contemplation, but only by a practical manifestation of
His goodness towards us, accompanied by an assurance
of our safety; and that this is fulfilled in Christianity not
by the amalgamation of the soul with the Deity, but by
the pouring out of God&rsquo;s Spirit upon His children, and by
the obedience and atonement of Christ. Vicarious suffering
is then defended by analogy, the truth of the Mosaic
and Christian miracles is upheld, and the whole argument
closes with proving the authenticity of the Christian annals
by their coincidence with profane history.</p></div>

<p>Sir William Muir agrees in the opinion of Professor
Lee that, situated as Mr. Martyn was in Persia, with a
short tract on the Mohammedan religion before him, and his
health precarious, the course which he took was perhaps
the only one practicable. Sir William adds: &lsquo;In pursuing
his argument Henry Martyn has displayed great wisdom
and skill, and his reasoning appears to be in general
perfectly conclusive; in a few instances, however, he has
perhaps not taken up the most advantageous ground.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The appeal of the Christian defender of the faith, at
the close of his second part, on the incarnation and atonement,
is marked by a loving courtesy:<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is now the prayer of the humble Henry Martyn that
these things may be considered with impartiality. If they
become the means of procuring conviction, let not the fear
of death or punishment operate for a moment to the
contrary, but let this conviction have its legitimate effect;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
for the world, we know, passes away like the wind of the
desert. But if what has here been stated do not produce
conviction, my prayer is that God Himself may instruct
you; that as hitherto ye have held what you believed to
be the truth, ye may now become teachers of that which is
really so; and that He may grant you to be the means of
bringing others to the knowledge of the same, through
Jesus Christ, who has loved us and washed us in His own
blood, to whom be the power and the glory for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p><i>1811, July 26.</i>&mdash;Mirza Ibrahim declared publicly before
all his disciples, &lsquo;that if I really confuted his arguments,
he should be bound in conscience to become a Christian.&rsquo;
Alas! from such a declaration I have little hope. His
general good character for uprightness and unbounded
kindness to the poor would be a much stronger reason
with me for believing that he may perhaps be a Cornelius.</p>

<p><i>August 2.</i>&mdash;Much against his will Mirza Ibrahim was
obliged to go to his brother, who is governor of some town
thirty-eight parasangs off. To the last moment he continued
talking with his nephew on the subject of his book,
and begged that, in case of his detention, my reply might
be sent to him.</p>

<p><i>August 7.</i>&mdash;My friends talked, as usual, much about
what they call Divine love; but I do not very well comprehend
what they mean. They love not the holy God,
but the god of their own imagination&mdash;a god who will let
them do as they please. I often remind Seyd Ali of one
defect in his system, which is, that there is no one to stand
between his sins and God. Knowing what I allude to, he
says, &lsquo;Well, if the death of Christ intervene, no harm;
Soofi-ism can admit this too.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>August 14.</i>&mdash;Returned to the city in a fever, which
continued all the next day until the evening!</p>

<p><i>August 15.</i>&mdash;Jani Khan, in rank corresponding to one
of our Scottish dukes, as he is the head of all the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
tribes of Persia, and chief of his own tribe, which consists
of twenty thousand families, called on Jaffir Ali Khan with
a message from the king. He asked me a great number
of questions, and disputed a little. &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;you consider us all as infidels!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;the
whole of you.&rsquo; He was mightily pleased with my frankness,
and mentioned it when he was going away.</p>

<p><i>August 22.</i>&mdash;The copyist having shown my answer to
Moodurris, called Moolla Akbar, he wrote on the margin
with great acrimony but little sense. Seyd Ali having
shown his remarks in some companies, they begged him
not to show them to me, for fear I should disgrace them all
through the folly of one man.</p>

<p><i>August 23.</i>&mdash;Ruza Kooli Mirza, the great-grandson of
Nadir Shah and Aga Mahommed Hasan, called. The
prince&rsquo;s nephew, hearing of my attack on Muhammad,
observed that the proper answer to it was the sword; but
the prince confessed that he began to have his doubts. On
his inquiring what were the laws of Christianity&mdash;meaning
the number of times of prayer, the different washings, &amp;c.&mdash;I
said that we had two commandments: &lsquo;Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul,
and all thy strength; and thy neighbour as thyself.&rsquo; He
asked, &lsquo;What could be better?&rsquo; and continued praising
them.</p>

<p>The Moolla Aga Mahommed Hasan, himself a
Moodurris, and a very sensible, candid man, asked a good
deal about the European philosophy, particularly what we
did in metaphysics; for instance, &lsquo;how, or in what sense,
the body of Christ ascended into heaven?&rsquo; He talked of
free-will and fate, and reasoned high, and at last reconciled
them according to the doctrines of the Soofis by saying,
that &lsquo;as all being is an emanation of the Deity, the will of
every being is only the will of the Deity, so that therefore,
in fact, free-will and fate are the same.&rsquo; He has nothing
to find fault with in Christianity, except the Divinity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Christ. It is this doctrine that exposes me to the contempt
of the learned Mahometans, in whom it is difficult to say
whether pride or ignorance predominates. Their sneers
are more difficult to bear than the brick-bats which the
boys sometimes throw at me; however, both are an honour
of which I am not worthy. How many times in the day
have I occasion to repeat the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">If on my face, for Thy dear name,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Shame and reproaches be,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">All hail, reproach, and welcome, shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">If Thou remember me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The more they wish me to give up this one point&mdash;the
Divinity of Christ&mdash;the more I seem to feel the necessity
of it, and rejoice and glory in it. Indeed, I trust I would
sooner give up my life than surrender it.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to pay a long-promised visit to
Mirza Abulkasim, one of the most renowned Soofis in all
Persia. We found several persons sitting in an open court,
in which a few greens and flowers were placed; the master
was in a corner. He was a very fresh-looking old man
with a silver beard. I was surprised to observe the downcast
and sorrowful looks of the assembly, and still more at the
silence which reigned. After sitting some time in expectation,
and being not at all disposed to waste my time
in sitting there, I said softly to Seyd Ali, &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo;
He said, &lsquo;It is the custom here to think much and speak
little.&rsquo; &lsquo;May I ask the master a question?&rsquo; said I. With
some hesitation he consented to let me; so I begged Jaffir
Ali to inquire, &lsquo;Which is the way to be happy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>This he did in his own manner; he began by observing
that &lsquo;there was a great deal of misery in the world, and
that the learned shared as largely in it as the rest; that I
wished therefore to know what we must do to escape it.&rsquo;
The master replied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span> &lsquo;for his part he did not know, but
that it was usually said that the subjugation of the passions
was the shortest way to happiness.&rsquo; After a considerable
pause I ventured to ask, &lsquo;What were his feelings at the
prospect of death&mdash;hope, or fear, or neither?&rsquo; &lsquo;Neither,&rsquo;
said he, and that &lsquo;pleasure and pain were both alike.&rsquo; I
then perceived that the Stoics were Greek Soofis. I asked
&lsquo;whether he had attained this apathy.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Why do you think it attainable?&rsquo; He could not tell.
&lsquo;Why do you think that pleasure and pain are not the
same?&rsquo; said Seyd Ali, taking his master&rsquo;s part. &lsquo;Because,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;I have the evidence of my senses for it. And you
also act as if there was a difference. Why do you eat, but
that you fear pain?&rsquo; These silent sages sat unmoved.</p>

<p>One of the disciples is the son of the Moojtahid who,
greatly to the vexation of his father, is entirely devoted to
the Soofi doctor. He attended his kalean (pipe) with the
utmost humility. On observing the pensive countenance
of the young man, and knowing something of his history
from Seyd Ali, how he had left all to find happiness in the
contemplation of God, I longed to make known the glad
tidings of a Saviour, and thanked God on coming away,
that I was not left ignorant of the Gospel. I could not
help being a little pleasant on Seyd Ali afterwards, for his
admiration of this silent instructor. &lsquo;There you sit,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;immersed in thought, full of anxiety and care, and will
not take the trouble to ask whether God has said anything
or not. No: that is too easy and direct a way of coming
at the truth. I compare you to spiders, who weave their
house of defence out of their own bowels; or to a set of
people who are groping for a light in broad day.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>August 26.</i>&mdash;Waited this morning on Mahommed
Nubbee Khan, late ambassador at Calcutta, and now prime
minister of Fars. There were a vast number of clients in
his court, with whom he transacted business while chatting
with us. Amongst the others who came and sat with us,
was my tetric adversary&mdash;Aga Akbar, who came for the
very purpose of presenting the minister with a little book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
he had written in answer to mine. After presenting it in
due form, he sat down, and told me he meant to bring me
a copy that day&mdash;a promise which he did not perform,
through Seyd Ali&rsquo;s persuasion, who told him it was a performance
that would do him no credit.</p>

<p><i>August 29.</i>&mdash;Mirza Ibrahim begins to inquire about
the Gospel. The objections he made were such as these:
How sins could be atoned for before they were committed?
Whether, as Jesus died for all men, all would
necessarily be saved? If faith be the condition of salvation,
would wicked Christians be saved, provided they
believe? I was pleased to see from the nature of the
objections that he was considering the subject. To this
last objection, I remarked that to those who felt themselves
sinners, and came to God for mercy, through Christ, God
would give His Holy Spirit, which would progressively
sanctify them in heart and life.</p>

<p><i>August 30.</i>&mdash;Mirza Ibrahim praises my answer, especially
the first part.</p></div>

<p>It was on the sacred rock of Behistun, on the western
frontiers of Media, on the high road eastward from
Babylonia, that Darius Hystaspes, founder of the civil
policy of ancient Persia, carved the wonderful cuneiform
inscriptions which made that rock the charter of Achæmenian
royalty. At Persepolis only the platform, the pillared
colonnade, and the palace seem to have been built by him;
the other buildings, with commemorative legends, were
erected by Xerxes and Artaxerxes Ochus. Lassen, Westergaard,
and our own Sir Henry Rawlinson,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> did not
decipher these inscriptions for some twenty years after
Martyn&rsquo;s visit. How deaf had Ormuzd proved all through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
the centuries to the prayer which Darius the king cut on a
huge slab, twenty-six feet in length and six in height, in
the southern wall of the great platform at Persepolis: &lsquo;Let
not war, nor slavery, nor decrepitude, nor lies obtain power
over this province.&rsquo; Henry Martyn thus wrote of his visit:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After traversing these celebrated ruins, I must say
that I felt a little disappointed: they did not at all answer
my expectation. The architecture of the ancient Persians
seems to me much more akin to that of their clumsy neighbours
the Indians, than to that of the Greeks. I saw no
appearance of grand design anywhere. The chapiters of
the columns were almost as long as the shafts:&mdash;though
they are not so represented in Niebuhr&rsquo;s plate;&mdash;and the
mean little passages into the square court, or room, or
whatever it was, make it very evident that the taste of the
Orientals was the same three thousand years ago as it is
now. But it was impossible not to recollect that here Alexander
and his Greeks passed and repassed; here they sat
and sung, and revelled; now all is in silence, generation
on generation lie mingled with the dust of their mouldering
edifices:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Alike the busy and the gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">But flutter in life&rsquo;s busy day,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">In fortune&rsquo;s varying colours drest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As soon as we recrossed the Araxes, the escort begged
me to point out the Keblah to them, as they wanted to pray.
After setting their faces towards Mecca, as nearly as I
could, I went and sat down on the margin near the bridge,
where the water, falling over some fragments of the bridge
under the arches, produced a roar, which, contrasted with
the stillness all around, had a grand effect. Here I thought
again of the multitudes who had once pursued their
labours and pleasures on its banks. Twenty-one centuries
have passed away since they lived; how short, in compari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>son,
must be the remainder of my days. What a momentary
duration is the life of man! <i>Labitur et labetur in omne
volubilis ævum</i>, may be affirmed of the river; but men
pass away as soon as they begin to exist. Well, let the
moments pass:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">They&rsquo;ll waft us sooner o&rsquo;er<br /></span>
<span class="i13">This life&rsquo;s tempestuous sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">And land us on the peaceful shore<br /></span>
<span class="i13">Of blest eternity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The true character of Martyn&rsquo;s Mohammedan and
Soofi controversialists comes out in the fast of Ramazan,
the ninth month of the lunar year, when from dawn to
sunset of each day a strict fast is observed, most trying to
the temper, and from sunset to dawn excess is too naturally
the rule, especially, as in this case, when Ramazan falls on
the long hot days of summer. Of this month the traditions
declare that the doors of heaven are opened and the doors
of hell shut, while the devils are chained. At this time the
miracle play of Hasan and Husain<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> is acted in the native
theatres from night to night. In scene xxxi. are enacted
the conversion and murder of an English ambassador.
Dean Stanley used to tell that Henry Martyn, horrified at
the English oaths put into the mouth of the Persian who
represented the ambassador in the tragedy, took him and
taught him to repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer instead.</p>

<p><i>September 20.</i>&mdash;First day of the fast of Ramazan.
All the family had been up in the night, to take an unseasonable
meal, in order to fortify themselves for the abstinence
of the day. It was curious to observe the effects of
the fast in the house. The master was scolding and beating
his servants; they equally peevish and insolent, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
beggars more than ordinarily importunate and clamorous.
At noon, all the city went to the grand mosque. My host
came back with an account of new vexations there. He
was chatting with a friend, near the door, when a great
preacher, Hajji Mirza, arrived, with hundreds of followers.
&lsquo;Why do you not say your prayers?&rsquo; said the new-comers
to the two friends. &lsquo;We have finished,&rsquo; said they. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said the other, &lsquo;if you cannot pray a second time with us,
you had better move out of the way.&rsquo; Rather than join
such turbulent zealots they retired. The reason of this
unceremonious address was, that these loving disciples had
a desire to pray all in a row with their master, which, it
seems, is the custom. There is no public service in the
mosque; every man here prays for himself.</p>

<p>Coming out of the mosque some servants of the prince,
for their amusement, pushed a person against a poor man&rsquo;s
stall, on which were some things for sale, a few European
and Indian articles, also some valuable Warsaw plates,
which were thrown down and broken. The servants went
off without making compensation. No kazi will hear a
complaint against the prince&rsquo;s servants.</p>

<p>Hajji Mahommed Hasan preaches every day during
the Ramazan. He takes a verse from the Koran, or more
frequently tells stories about the Imams. If the ritual of
the Christian Churches, their good forms and everything
they have, is a mere shadow without a Divine influence
attend on them, what must all this Mahometan stuff be?
and yet how impossible is it to convince the people of the
world, whether Christian or Mahometan, that what they
call religion is merely an invention of their own, having
no connection with God and His kingdom! This subject
has been much on my mind of late. How senseless the
zeal of Churchmen against dissenters, and of dissenters
against the Church! The kingdom of God is neither meat
nor drink, nor anything perishable; but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>Mirza Ibrahim never goes to the mosque, but he is
so much respected that nothing is said: they conclude
that he is employed in devotion at home. Some of his
disciples said to Seyd Ali, before him: &lsquo;Now the Ramazan
is come, you should read the Koran and leave the Gospel.&rsquo;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said his uncle, &lsquo;he is employed in a good work: let
him go on with it.&rsquo; The old man continues to inquire
with interest about the Gospel, and is impatient for his
nephew to explain the evidences of Christianity, which I
have drawn up.</p>

<p><i>September 22.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;My friends returned from
the mosque, full of indignation at what they had witnessed
there. The former governor of Bushire complained to the
vizier, in the mosque, that some of his servants had treated
him brutally. The vizier, instead of attending to his
complaint, ordered them to do their work a second time;
which they did, kicking and beating him with their slippers,
in the most ignominious way, before all the mosque. This
unhappy people groan under the tyranny of their governors;
yet nothing subdues or tames them. Happy Europe! how
has God favoured the sons of Japheth, by causing them to
embrace the Gospel. How dignified are all the nations of
Europe compared with this nation! Yet the people are
clever and intelligent, and more calculated to become great
and powerful than any of the nations of the East, had they
a good government and the Christian religion.</p>

<p><i>September 29.</i>&mdash;The Soofi, son of the Moojtahid, with
some others, came to see me. For fifteen years he was a
devout Mahometan; visited the sacred places, and said
many prayers. Finding no benefit from austerities he
threw up Mahommedanism altogether, and attached himself
to the Soofi master. I asked him what his object was,
all that time? He said, he did not know, but he was unhappy.
I began to explain to him the Gospel; but he
cavilled at it as much as any bigoted Mahommedan
could do, and would not hear of there being any distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
between Creator and creature. In the midst of our conversation,
the sun went down, and the company vanished
for the purpose of taking an immediate repast.</p>

<p>Mirza Seyd Ali seems sometimes coming round to
Christianity against Soofi-ism. The Soofis believe in no
prophet, and do not consider Moses to be equal to Mirza
Abulkasim. &lsquo;Could they be brought,&rsquo; Seyd Ali says, &lsquo;to
believe that there has been a prophet, they would embrace
Christianity.&rsquo; And what would be gained by such converts?
&lsquo;Thy people shall be willing in the day of Thy
power.&rsquo; It will be an afflicted and poor people that shall
call upon the name of the Lord, and such the Soofis are
not: professing themselves to be wise, they have become
fools.</p>

<p><i>October 7.</i>&mdash;I was surprised by a visit from the great
Soofi doctor, who, while most of the people were asleep,
came to me for some wine. I plied him with questions
innumerable; but he returned nothing but incoherent
answers, and sometimes no answer at all. Having laid
aside his turban, he put on his night-cap, and soon fell
asleep upon the carpet. Whilst he lay there his disciples
came, but would not believe, when I told them who was
there, till they came and saw the sage asleep. When he
awoke, they came in, and seated themselves at the greatest
possible distance, and were all as still as if in a church.
The real state of this man seems to be despair, and it will
be well if it do not end in madness. I preached to him
the kingdom of God: mentioning particularly how I had
found peace from the Son of God and the Spirit of God;
through the first, forgiveness; through the second, sanctification.
He said it was good, but said it with the same
unconcern with which he admits all manner of things, however
contradictory. Poor soul! he is sadly bewildered.</p></div>

<p>As a Persian scholar and controversialist Henry Martyn
found a worthy successor in the German, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
Church Missionary Society&rsquo;s missionary, C.G. Pfander, D.D.
When for some twelve years stationed at Shushy Fort, on
the Russian border of Georgia, he frequently visited Baghdad
and travelled through Persia by Ispahan and Teheran. In
1836 the intolerant Russian Government expelled all
foreign missionaries from its territories, and Dr. Pfander
joined the Church Mission at Agra. In 1835 he first
published at Shushy, in Persian, his famous <i>Mizan ul Haqq</i>,
or <i>Balance of Truth</i>. A Hindustani translation was lithographed
at Mirzapore in 1843, and Mr. R.H. Weakley,
missionary at Constantinople, made an English translation,
which was published by the Church Missionary Society in
1867. This, as yet, greatest of works which state the
general argument for Christianity and against Islam, was
followed by the <i>Miftah ul Asrar</i>, in proof of the Divinity of
Christ and the doctrine of the Trinity, and by the <i>Tarik ul
Hyat</i>, or the nature of sin and the way of salvation, of both
of which Hindustani translations appeared. In his little
English <i>Remarks on the Nature of Muhammadanism</i>,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> as
shown in the <i>Traditions</i>, Dr. Pfander quotes from Martyn&rsquo;s
<i>Controversy</i>. By these writings and the personal controversy
in India, Dr. Pfander, following Henry Martyn, was
the means of winning to Christ, in tolerant British India,
many Mohammedan moulvies like him who is now the
Rev. Imad-ud-din, D.D.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s description of the Persian is no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
applicable to the Indian Mohammedan, in the opinion of Sir
William Muir; &lsquo;he is a compound of ignorance and bigotry,
and all access to the one is hedged up by the other.&rsquo; The
Koran and the whole system of Islam are based on partial
truths, plagiarised from Scripture to an extent sufficient to
feed the pride of those who hold them. But beyond these
corruptions of Judaism and Christianity, for which the
dead Eastern Churches of Mohammed&rsquo;s time and since are
responsible, Persians, Turks, Arabs, Afghans, and Hindustan
Muhammadans know nothing either of history or
Christian Divinity. All controversy, from P.H. Xavier&rsquo;s
time to Martyn&rsquo;s, Wilson&rsquo;s, and Pfander&rsquo;s, shows that the key
of the position is not the doctrine of the Trinity, as the
Shi&rsquo;ah Moojtahids of Shiraz and Lucknow and the Soonnis
everywhere make it, but the genuineness and integrity of
the Scriptures, by which the truth of the whole Christian
faith will follow, the Trinity included. The Bible, in
Hindustani, Persian, and Arabic, with its self-evidencing
power, is the weapon which Henry Martyn was busied in
forging.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="subheading">IN PERSIA&mdash;TRANSLATING THE SCRIPTURES</p>


<p>Great as saint and notable as scholar, in the twelve years
of his young life from Senior Wrangler to martyr at
thirty-one years of age, the highest title of Henry Martyn
to everlasting remembrance is that he gave the Persians in
their own tongue the Testament of the one Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, and the Hebrew Psalms. By that
work, the fruit of which every successive century will
reveal till the consummation of the ages, he unconsciously
wrote his name beside those of the greatest missionaries in
the history of the Church of Christ, the sacred scholars
who were the first to give the master races of Asia and
Africa, of Europe and America, the Word of God in
their vernaculars. Let us write the golden list, which for
modern Africa and Oceania also we might inscribe in
letters of silver,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> were not most of the translators still living

<p>It was David Brown who was wont to call the Bible &lsquo;The
Great Missionary which would speak in all tongues the
wonderful works of God.&rsquo;</p>

<p>From first to last and above all Henry Martyn was a
philologist. His school and college honours sprang from
the root of all linguistic studies, Greek and Latin, in which
he was twice appointed public examiner in his college and
the University of Cambridge. For the uncritical time in
which he lived, and the generations which followed his to
the present, he was an enthusiastic and accomplished
Hebraist. No young scholar in the first quarter of the
nineteenth century was so well equipped for translating the
Bible by a knowledge of its two original languages. True,
he was the Senior Wrangler of the year 1801, but to him
the honour was a &lsquo;shadow,&rsquo; because the mathematical
sciences could do nothing for him as a translator and
preacher of the words of righteousness, compared with the
linguistic. Only once, when the rapture of his holy work
had carried him away to the borderland of a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
metaphysical theology, did he record the passing regret
that he had abandoned the rationalistic ground of mathematical
certainty. His devotion to the study of the
languages which interpret and apply to the races of India,
Arabia, and Persia, the books of the Christian Revelation,
was so absorbing as to shorten his career. Like Carey, he
never knew an idle moment, even when on shipboard, and
he jealously guarded his time from correspondence, other
than that with Lydia Grenfell, Brown and Corrie, that he
might live to finish the Hindustani, Persian, and Arabic
New Testaments at least. The spiritual motive it was, the
desire to win every man to Christ, that urged his unresting
course, and in the sacred toil he had the reflex joy of being
himself won nearer and nearer by the Spirit.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What do I not owe to the Lord for permitting me
to take part in a translation of His Word? Never did I
see such wonder, and wisdom, and love in that blessed
book as since I have been obliged to study every expression.
All day on the translation, employed a good while
at night in considering a difficult passage, and being much
enlightened respecting it, I went to bed full of astonishment
at the wonders of God&rsquo;s Word. Never before did I see
anything of the beauty of the language and the importance
of the thoughts as I do now. I felt happy that I should
never be finally separated from the contemplation of them,
or of the things concerning which they are written.
Knowledge shall vanish away, but it shall be because
perfection has come.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, he was ever on the watch against the
deadening influence of routine or one-sided study.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span> &lsquo;So
constantly engaged with outward works of translation of
languages that I fear my inward man has declined in
spirituality.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Canon Edmonds expresses the experience of the
present writer in the remark,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that to read Martyn&rsquo;s
<i>Journal</i> with the single object of noticing this point is to
discover another Martyn, not a saint only, but a grammarian.
&lsquo;He read grammars as other men read novels,
and to him they were more entertaining than novels.&rsquo; So
early as September 28, 1804, in Cambridge we find him at
prayer after dinner, before visiting Wall&rsquo;s Lane, and then
on his return finishing the Bengali Grammar which he had
begun the day before. &lsquo;I am anxious to get Carey&rsquo;s
Bengali New Testament,&rsquo; which could not long have
reached London. Five days after, Thomas à Kempis,
followed by hymns and the writing of a sermon, seemed
but the preliminary to his Hindustani as well as Bengali
studies. &lsquo;Engaged all the rest of the morning by Gilchrist&rsquo;s
Hindustani Dictionary. After dinner began
Halhed&rsquo;s Bengali Grammar, for I found that the other
grammar I had been reading was only for the corrupted
Hindustani.&rsquo; The first traces of his Persian and Arabic
studies have an interest all their own:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1804, June 27.</i>&mdash;A funeral and calls of friends took up
my time till eleven; afterwards <i>read Persian</i>, and made
some calculations in trigonometry, in order to be familiar
with the use of logarithms.</p>

<p><i>November 23.</i>&mdash;Through shortness of time I was about
to omit my morning portion of Scripture, yet after some
deliberation conscience prevailed, and I enjoyed a solemn
seriousness in learning &lsquo;mem&rsquo; in the 119th Psalm. Wasted
much time afterwards in looking over <i>an Arabic grammar</i>.</p></div>

<p>When fairly at work in Dinapore he wrote almost daily
such passages in his <i>Journal</i> as these:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1807, August 25.</i>&mdash;Translating the Epistles; reading
Arabic grammar and Persian. 27 to 29.&mdash;Studies in
Persian and Arabic the same. Delight in them, particularly
the latter, so great, that I have been obliged to pray
continually that they may not be a snare to me....
31st.&mdash;Resumed the Arabic with an eagerness which I
found it necessary to check. Began some extracts from
Cashefi which Mr. Gladwin sent me, and thus the day
passed rapidly away. Alas! how much more readily does
the understanding do its work than the heart.</p></div>

<p>On reaching Calcutta in 1806 Martyn found this to be
the position of the Bible translation work. Carey&rsquo;s early
labours had led to the formation of the other English and
Scottish Missionary Societies at the close of the last
century. By 1803 his experience and that of his colleagues
had enabled them, with the encouragement of Brown and
Buchanan, to formulate a magnificent plan for translating
the Bible into all the languages of the far East.
The Marquis Wellesley, though Governor-General, approved,
and his College at Fort William, with its staff of learned
men, including Carey himself and many Asiatics, had
become a school of interpreters. In 1804, after all this,
the British and Foreign Bible Society was founded, under
the ex-Governor-General, Lord Teignmouth, as its first
president. That Society, leaving India to the Serampore
Brotherhood, at once directed its attention to the three
hundred millions of Chinese, who also could be reached
only through the East India Company. But, until six
years after, when Dr. Marshman made the first reliable
translation of the Bible into the language, in its Mandarin
dialect, there was no Chinese translation save an anonymous
MS. of a large portion of the New Testament in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Museum, probably of Roman Catholic origin. At that
time the infant Society did not see its way to spend two
thousand guineas in producing an edition of a thousand
copies of a work about which the few experts differed.
So, while giving grants to the Serampore translators, it invited
the opinions, as to the formation of a corresponding
committee in Calcutta, of George Udny, who had by that
time become Member of Council, and the Rev. Messrs.
Brown, Buchanan, Carey, Ward, and Marshman. The
Serampore plan and its rapid execution had been communicated
to all the principal civil and military officials, who,
after Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s tolerant and reverent action, subscribed
liberally to carry it out, and the Society continued
its grants. But when in 1807, under Lord Minto, the
anti-Christian reaction set in, caused by a groundless panic
as to the Vellore Mutiny, and the Fort William College was
reduced, Dr. Buchanan proposed to found &lsquo;The Christian
Institution,&rsquo; the Society preferred its original plan of a corresponding
committee, which was formed in August 1809.</p>

<p>Martyn had not waited one hour for this. Almost from
the day of landing at the capital he was engaged in
Hindustani translation, and in studious preparation for his
projected Persian and Arabic Bibles. In the brotherly
intercourse at Aldeen with the Serampore missionaries it
was arranged to leave these three languages entirely to
him, under the direction of Mr. Brown. Part of the
Society&rsquo;s annual grant to India and Ceylon of a thousand
pounds a year was assigned to pay his assistants, Mirza
Fitrut, the Persian, and Nathanael Sabat, the Arabian, and
to print the results. The Corresponding Committee caused
an annual sermon to be preached in Calcutta, to rouse
public intelligence and help. On the first day of 1810<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
Mr. Brown preached it in the old church, in the interest chiefly
of the thousands of native Christians who had been baptized
in Tanjor and Tinnevelli, both Reformed and Romanist,
and needed copies of the Tamul Bible. Such was the result
of this appeal, headed by the Commander-in-chief, General
Hewett, with the sum of 2,000 Sicca-rupees (250<i>l.</i>), that the
committee resolved on establishing a &lsquo;Bibliotheca Biblica,&rsquo;
combining a Bible Repository and a Translation Library.
The Scottish poet and friend of Sir Walter Scott, Dr.
Leyden, was foremost in the enterprise, and took charge
of work in the languages of Siam and the Spice Islands, as
well as in the Pushtu of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>On the first day of 1811 it fell to the Rev. Henry
Martyn to preach the second annual sermon.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> His appeal
was for not only the growing native Church of India,
but more particularly for the whole number of nominal
Christians, of all sects, in India and Ceylon, whom he
estimated at 900,000.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In 1881 the Government census
returned these, in the Greater India of our day but without
Ceylon, as upwards of 2,000,000, and in 1891 as
2,280,549. Martyn&rsquo;s figures included 342,000 of the
Singhalese, whom the Dutch had compelled by secular
considerations outwardly to conform. The sermon, on
Galatians vi. 10, was published at the time, and it appears
as the last in the volume of <i>Twenty Sermons by the late
Rev. Henry Martyn, B.D.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> first printed at Calcutta with
this passage in the preface:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span> &lsquo;The desire to know how such
a man preached is natural and unavoidable.... His
manner in the pulpit was distinguished by a holy solemnity,
always suited to the high message which he was delivering,
and accompanied by an unction which made its way to the
hearts of his audience. With this was combined a fidelity
at once forcible by its justice and intrepidity, and penetrating
by its affection. There was, in short, a power of
holy love and disinterested earnestness in his addresses
which commended itself to every man&rsquo;s conscience in the
sight of God.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Addressing the well-paid servants of the East India
Company in Calcutta, and its prosperous merchants and
shopkeepers, the preacher said: &lsquo;Do we not blush at the
offers of assistance from home ... where all that is raised
may be employed with such effect in benefiting the other
three quarters of the globe? Asia must be our care; or, if
not Asia, <i>India</i> at least must look to none but us. Honour
calls as well as duty.&rsquo; He then continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Prove to our friends and the world that the Mother
Country need never be ashamed of her sons in India. What
a splendid spectacle does she present! Standing firm
amidst the overthrow of the nations, and spreading wide
the shadow of her wings for the protection of all, she finds
herself at leisure, amidst the tumult of war, to form benevolent
projects for the best interests of mankind. Her
generals and admirals have caused the thunder of her
power to be heard throughout the south; now her ministers
of religion perform their part, and endeavour to fulfil the
high destinies of Heaven in favour of their country. They
called on their fellow-citizens to cheer the desponding nations
with the Book of the promises of Eternal Life, and thus
afford them that consolation from the prospect of a happier
world, which they have little expectation of finding amidst
the disasters and calamities of this. The summons was
obeyed. As fast as the nature of the undertaking became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
understood, and was perceived to be clearly distinct from
all party business and visionary project, great numbers of
all ranks in society, and of all persuasions in religion, joined
with one heart and one soul, and began to impart freely to
all men that which, next to the Saviour, is God&rsquo;s best gift
to man....</p>

<p>Shall every town and hamlet in England engage in the
glorious cause, and the mighty Empire of India do nothing?
Will not our wealth and dignity be our disgrace if we do
not employ it for God and our fellow-creatures? What
plan could be proposed, so little open to objections, and so
becoming our national character and religion, so simple and
practicable, yet so extensively beneficial, as that of giving
the Word of God to the Christian part of our native
subjects?... Despise not their inferiority, nor reproach
them for their errors; they cannot get a <span class="smcap">Bible</span> to read;
had they been blessed with your advantages, they would
have been perhaps more worthy of your respect.</p></div>

<p>The brief decade of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s working life fell
at a time when the science of Comparative Philology was
as yet unborn, but the materials were almost ready for
generalisation. Sir William Jones, and still more his
successor as a scholar&mdash;Henry Thomas Colebrooke&mdash;had
used their opportunities in India well. The Bengal Asiatic
Society, in its <i>Asiatic Researches</i>, was laboriously piling up
facts and speculations. These awaited only the flash of
hardworking genius to evolve the order and the laws which
have made Comparative Grammar the most fruitful of the
historical and psychological sciences. It might have been
Martyn&rsquo;s, had he lived to reach England, to manifest that
genius. His Asiatic career was contemporary with the
most fruitful part of Colebrooke&rsquo;s. He toiled and he
speculated, as he mastered the grammar and much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
vocabulary of the great classical and vernacular languages
which made him a seven-tongued man. But his divine
motive led him to grope for the philological solvent through
the imperfect Semitic. The Germans, Schlegel and Bopp,
found it rather, and later, in the richer Aryan or Indo-European
family, in Sanskrit and old Persian.</p>

<p>His longing to give the Arabs the Scriptures in their
purity intensified his devotion to the study of Hebrew;
had he lived to give himself to the Persian, he might have
anticipated the German critics who used, at second-hand,
the materials that he and Colebrooke, and other servants
of the East India Company, were annually accumulating.
Nor did his Hebraism lead him, at the beginning of the
century, to that fertile criticism of the text and the literary
origin of the books of the Old Testament which, at the end
of the century, is beginning to make the inspired historians
and the prophets, the psalmists and the moralists of the old
Jews live anew for the modern Church. But how true has
proved his prediction to Corrie in the year 1809:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I think that when the construction of Hebrew is fully
understood, all the scholars in the world will turn to it with
avidity, in order to understand other languages, and then
the Word of God will be studied universally.</p></div>

<p>Again in 1810:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I sit for hours alone contemplating this mysterious
language. If light does not break upon me at last it will
be a great loss of time, as I never read Arabic or Persian.
I have no heart to do it; I cannot condescend any longer
to tread in the paths of ignorant and lying grammarians.
I sometimes say in my vain heart I will make a deep cut
in the mine of philology, or I will do nothing; but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
shall hear no more of Scriptural philology till I make some
notable discoveries.</p></div>

<p>Again in 1811, when at Bombay:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Chiefly employed on the Arabic tract, writing letters to
Europe, and my Hebrew speculations. The last encroached
so much on my time and thoughts that I lost two nights&rsquo;
sleep, and consequently the most of two days, without
learning more than I did the first hour.</p>

<p>Happening to think this evening on the nature of language
more curiously and deeply than I have yet done, I got
bewildered, and fancied I saw some grounds for the opinions
of those who deny the existence of matter.... Oh, what
folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss!... The
further I push my inquiries the more I am distressed.
It must be now my prayer, not &lsquo;Lord, let me obtain the
knowledge which I think would be so useful,&rsquo; but &lsquo;Oh,
teach me just as much as Thou seest good for me.&rsquo; Compared
with metaphysics, physics and mathematics appear
with a kind and friendly aspect, because they seem to be
within the limits in which man can move without danger,
but on the other I find myself adrift. Synthesis is the
work of God alone.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s first practical work was in Hindustani.
His position in Dinapore and Patna, the capital of Bihar
with its Hindi dialects, his duties to the native wives and
families of the soldiers whom he taught and exhorted,
his preaching to the Hindus and discussions with the
Mohammedans, all led him to prepare three works&mdash;(1)
portions of the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, which Corrie
finished and published seventeen years after his death;
(2) a <i>Commentary on the Parables</i>, in 1807; (3) the <i>Four
Gospels</i> in 1809, and in 1810 the whole <i>New Testament</i>.
Let us look at him in his spiritual and scholarly workshop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1807, January 18.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Preached on Numbers
xxiii. 19: a serious attention from all. Most of the
European tradesmen were present with their families; my
soul enjoyed sweet peace and heavenly-mindedness for
some time afterwards. The thought suddenly struck me
to-day, how easy it would be to translate the chief part
of the Church Service for the use of the soldiers&rsquo; wives,
and women and children, and so have the service in
Hindustani, by which a door would be opened to the
heathen. This thought took such hold of me, that after
in vain endeavouring to fix my thoughts on anything else,
I sat down in the evening, and translated to the end of
the <i>Te Deum</i>. But my conscience was not satisfied that
this was a Sabbath employment, and I lost the sensible
sweetness of the Divine presence. However, by leaving it
off, and passing the rest of the evening in reading and
singing hymns, I found comfort and joy. Oh, how shall I
praise my Lord, that here in this solitude, with people
enough indeed, but without any like-minded, I yet enjoy
fellowship with all those who in every place call upon the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I see myself travelling on
with them, and I hope I shall worship with them in His
courts above.</p>

<p><i>January 19.</i>&mdash;Passed the morning with the moonshi and
pundit, dictating to the former a few ideas for the explanation
of the Parable of the Rich Fool. When I came to say
that there was no eating and drinking, etc., in heaven, but
only the pleasures of God&rsquo;s presence and holiness; and
that, therefore, we must acquire a taste for such pleasures,
the Mussulman was unwilling to write, but the Brahman
was pleased, and said that all this was in the Puranas.
Afterwards went on with the translation of the Liturgy.</p>

<p><i>March 23.</i> (To Brown.)&mdash;It is with no small delight that
I find the day arrived for my writing to my very dear brother.
Many thanks for your two letters, and for all the consolation
contained in them, and many thanks to our Lord and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Saviour, who has given me such a help where I once
expected to struggle on alone all my days. Concerning
the character in the Nagri papers you have sent me I have
to say, it is perfectly the same as the one used here, and I
can read it easily; and the difference in both the dialects
from the one here is so trifling, that I have not the smallest
doubt of the Parables being understood at Benares and
Bettia (a Roman Catholic village), and consequently
through a vast tract of country. A more important
inference is, that in whatever dialect of the Hindustani
the translation of the Scriptures shall be made, it will be
generally understood. The little book of Parables is at
last finished, through the blessing of God. I cannot say
I am very well pleased with it on the reperusal; but yet
containing, as it does, such large portions of the Word of God,
I ought not to doubt of its accomplishing that which He
pleaseth.</p>

<p><i>July 13.</i>&mdash;Mr. Ward has also sent me a long and learned
letter. He is going to print the Parables without delay
for me, and the modern Hindustani version of them for
themselves. He says, &lsquo;The enmity of the natives to the
Gospel is indeed very great, but on this point the lower
orders are angels compared with the moonshis and
pundits. I believe the man you took from Serampore
has his heart as full of this poison as most. The fear
of loss of caste among the poor is a greater obstacle
than their enmity. Our strait waistcoat makes our arms
ache.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>December 29.</i>&mdash;Translating from Hebrew into Hindustani
in the morning. Wrote to Mr. Udny. Read Arabic
and Persian as usual with Sabat. We had some conversation
on this subject, whether we might not expect the Holy
Spirit would endue us with extraordinary powers in the
acquisition of languages, if we could pray for it only with
a desire to be useful to the Church of God, and not with
a wish for our own glory. There seemed to be no reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
against such an expectation. I sometimes pray for the
gifts of the spirit, but infinitely greater is the necessity to
pray for grace, as I know by the sorrowful experience of
my deceitfully corrupt heart.</p>

<p><i>1808, January 7.</i>&mdash;As much of my time as was not
employed for the Europeans has been devoted chiefly to
translating the Epistles into Hindustani. This work is
finished after a certain manner. But Sabat does not allow
me to form a very high idea of the style in which it is
executed. But if the work should fail&mdash;which, however,
I am far from expecting&mdash;my labour will have been richly
repaid by the profit and pleasure derived from considering
the Word of God in the original with more attention than
I had ever done.</p>

<p><i>March 31.</i>&mdash;I am at present employed in the toilsome
work of going through the Syriac Gospels, and writing out
the names, in order to ascertain their orthography if possible,
and correcting with Mirza the Epistles. This last
work is incredibly difficult in Hindustani, and will be
nearly as much so in Persian, but very easy and elegant
in Arabic.</p>

<p><i>June 1</i> to <i>4</i>.&mdash;Employed incessantly in reading the
Persian of St. Matthew to Sabat. Met with the Italian
padre, Julius, with whom I conversed in French.</p>

<p><i>June 6.</i>&mdash;Going on with the Persian Gospel, visiting the
hospital, and with the men at night. My spirit refreshed
and revived by every night&rsquo;s ministration to them. Sent
the Persian of Matthew to Mr. Brown for the press, and
went on with the remainder of the Hindustani of St.
Matthew. I have not felt such trials of my temper for
many months as to-day. The General declared he was
an enemy to my design in translating the Scriptures. My
poor harassed soul looked at last to God, and cast its
burden of sin at the foot of the cross. Towards evening
I found rest and peace. A son-in-law of the Qasi ool
Qoorrat, of Patna, a very learned man, called on me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
put to him several questions about Mohammedanism, which
confused him; and as he seemed a grave, honest man, they
may produce lasting doubts.</p>

<p><i>1809, September 24.</i>&mdash;Began with Mirza Fitrut the
correction of the Hindustani Gospels: <i>Quod felix faustumque
sit.</i> Began with my men a course of lectures from
the beginning of the Bible.</p>

<p><i>September 25</i> to <i>28</i>.&mdash;Revising Arabic version of
Romans; going on in correction of Hindustani; preparing
report of progress in translating for Bible Society. Reading
occasionally Menishi&rsquo;s <i>Turkish Grammar</i>.</p></div>

<p>Completed in 1810, Martyn&rsquo;s Hindustani New Testament
for Mohammedans was passing through the Serampore
press when the great fire of March 11, 1812, destroyed
all the sheets save the first thirteen chapters of Matthew&rsquo;s
Gospel, and melted the fount of Persian type. The Corresponding
Committee of the British and Foreign Bible
Society, for which it had been prepared, put it to press the
second time at Serampore, from finer type, and it appeared
in 1814 in an edition of 2,000 copies, on English paper.
The demand for portions for immediate use was such that
3,000 copies of the Gospels and Acts, on Patna paper, had
been previously struck off. The longing translator&mdash;who
had once written, &lsquo;Oh, may I have the bliss of soon seeing
the New Testament in Hindustani and Persian!&rsquo;&mdash;had then
been two years dead, but verily his works followed him.
Such was the reputation of the version that it was read in
the native schools at Agra and elsewhere; while an edition
of 2,000 copies in the Deva-Nagri character, for Hindus,
appeared in 1817, and was used up till a Hindi version
was prepared from it by Mr. Bowley, the zealous agent of
the Church Missionary Society at Chunar, by divesting it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
of the Persian and Arabic terms. Bishop Corrie&rsquo;s revision
of this work and portions of the Old Testament were circulated
in many editions and extending numbers, in the
Kaithi character also, among the millions of Hindus who
speak the most widespread of Indian languages with many
dialects. The Bible Society in London welcomed Martyn&rsquo;s
work, of which Professor Lee prepared a large edition.
Learning that the lamented scholar had done some work
on the Old Testament in Hindustani, and had taught
Mirza Fitrut Hebrew, to enable that able moonshi to carry
on the translation from the original, the Society first published
Genesis in Hindustani, under Professor Lee&rsquo;s care, in
1817, and then issued a revision of the rough draft of the
entire version of the Old Testament, by Bishop Corrie and
Mr. Thomason. In 1843 Mr. Schürmann, of the London
Missionary Society, and Mr. Justice Hawkins, an elder of
the Free Church of Scotland and an accomplished Bengal
civilian, issued a uniform revision of the Old and New
Testaments in the Arabic and Roman characters, in the
course of which Mr. Schürmann &lsquo;saw reason to revert in a
great measure to the translation of Henry Martyn, especially
in the latter half of the version.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Of the different
translations of the Bible into Hindustani, the Oordoo or
&lsquo;camp&rsquo; language understood by the sixty millions of
Mussulmans in India, this criticism is just: &lsquo;the idiomatic
and faithful version of Henry Martyn still maintains its
ground, although, from the lofty elegance of its style, it is
better understood by educated than by illiterate Mohammedans.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>In the first generation, from 1814 to 1847, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
appearance of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s work, sixteen editions<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> of
the Hindustani New Testament were published and sent
into circulation among the then fifty millions of Mussulmans
in India. Before Martyn&rsquo;s work was printed, he and
Corrie used to dictate to inquirers translations of Bible
passages suited to their needs. When Corrie was at
Chunar, he tells us, because &lsquo;there was not at that time
any translation of the Scriptures to put into his hands, a
native Roman Catholic took down the translated texts on
loose pieces of paper.&rsquo; Years after, Mr. Wilkinson, of
Gorakpore, was called to visit the man on his death-bed,
and found him so well acquainted with Scripture that
he asked an explanation. &lsquo;The poor man produced the
loose slips of paper on which he had written my translations,&rsquo;
says Corrie. &lsquo;On these, it appeared, his soul had
fed through life, and through them he died such a death
that Mr. Wilkinson entertained no doubt of his having
passed into glory.&rsquo; In the forty years since the sixteen
editions made the Word of God known to thousands of
India Mussulmans, the Oordoo Bible has caused the Word
to grow mightily, and in many cases to prevail.</p>

<p>The entire Bible in Hindustani was again revised, by
Dr. R.C. Mather, after many years&rsquo; experience in Benares
and Mirzapore, and was published, in both the Arabic and
Roman characters, in 1869, after continuous labour for more
than six years. He stumbled, in the library of the British
and Foreign Bible Society, on sixteen manuscript volumes
of a Hindustani translation of nearly the whole Old Testament,
beginning with Martyn&rsquo;s Genesis. The folios were
interleaved, and on the blank pages were thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
notes in English. At the end of the Pentateuch the copyist
records that &lsquo;the above has been completed, by order of
Paymaster Sherwood, for the Rev. Daniel Corrie, by me,
Mákhdum Buksh.&rsquo; The copy seems to have been the
accomplished Thomason&rsquo;s, and to have been deposited in
the library by his widow after his death at Port Louis,
Mauritius. This practically complete translation of the
Old Testament had been lost for forty years. The eulogy
passed by Thomason on Martyn&rsquo;s Hindustani New Testament,
that it &lsquo;will last as a model of elegant writing as well
as of faithful translation,&rsquo; is pronounced by Dr. Mather,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
after all that time, as, &lsquo;in the main, just; the work has lasted
and continued to be acceptable, and will perhaps always
continue to be useful. All subsequent translators have, as
a matter of course, proceeded upon it as a work of excellent
skill and learning, and rigid fidelity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The modern Arabic translation of the New Testament,
by Martyn and Sabat, was not printed (in Calcutta) till
1816, and the translation of the Old Testament was continued
under the supervision of Mr. Thomason, who became
virtually Martyn&rsquo;s literary executor, and whose labours as
Oriental translator and editor hurried him, like his friend,
to a premature death. Both had the same biographer&mdash;the
good Sargent, Rector of Lavington. As Thomason
toiled at the Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani editions, he
wrote: &lsquo;I am filled with astonishment at the opening
scenes of usefulness. Send us labourers&mdash;send us faithful
laborious labourers!&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Martyn&rsquo;s Arabic New Testament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
produced with the assistance of an undoubtedly learned
Arab, as conceited and of temper as intolerable as Sabat,
did its work among the &lsquo;learned and fastidious&rsquo; Mohammedans
for whom chiefly it was prepared. Professor Lee
issued a second edition in London, and Mr. Thomason
a third in Calcutta. In common with the old translations,
made for the land in which St. Paul began the first missionary
work, and reproduced in various Polyglot Bibles, it has
been superseded by the wonderfully perfect and altogether
beautiful Arabic Bible (Beirut) of Dr. Eli Smith and Dr.
Van Dyck, on which these American scholars, assisted by
learned natives of Syria and Cairo, were occupied for nearly
thirty years. In the Beirut Arabic Scriptures, Henry
Martyn&rsquo;s troubled life with Sabat found early and luxuriant
fruit. How wisely and humbly the missionary chaplain
of the East India Company estimated his own, and
especially his Arabic, translations, and how at the same
time he longed to live that he might do in 1812-20 what
Eli Smith and Van Dyck did in 1837-65, may be seen
from these early letters and journals:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To the Rev. David Brown, Calcutta</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
Cawnpore: June 11, 1810.
</p>

<p>Dearest Sir,&mdash;The excessive heat, by depriving me of
my rest at night, keeps me between sleeping and waking
all day. This is one reason why I have been remiss in
answering your letters. It must not, however, be concealed
that the man Daniel Corrie has kept me so long talking that
I have had no time for writing since his arrival.</p>

<p>Your idea about presenting splendid copies of the
Scriptures to native great men has often struck me, but my
counsel is, not to do it with the first edition. I have too
little faith in the instruments to believe that the first editions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
will be excellent; and if they should be found defective,
we cannot after once presenting the great men with one
book, repeat the thing.</p>

<p>Before the second edition of the Arabic, what say you
to my carrying the first with me to Arabia, having under
the other arm the Persian, to be examined at Shiraz
or Teheran? By the time they are both ready I shall have
nearly finished my seven years, and may go on furlough.</p>

<p>I am glad to find you promising to give yourself wholly
to your plans. I always tremble lest Mrs. Brown should
order you home; but I must not suspect her, she has the
soul of a missionary. If you go soon we shall all droop
and die. Your Polyglot speculations are fine, but Polyglots
are Biblical luxuries, intended for the gratification of men
of two tongues or more. We must first feed those that
have but one, especially as single tongues are growing upon
us so fast.</p>

<p><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;To-day I have requested the Commander of
the forces to detain D. Corrie here to assist me; he said he
did not like to make innovations, but would keep him
here for two or three months. This will be a great relief
to my labouring chest, for I am still far from being out of
the fear of consumption. Tell me that you have prayed
for me.</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
H.M.
</p>
<hr class="shorthr" />

<p><i>August 22.</i>&mdash;I want silence and diversion, a little dog to
play with; or what would be best of all, a dear little child,
such as Fanny was when I left her. Perhaps you could
learn when the ships usually sail for Mocha. I have set
my heart upon going there; I could be there and back in
six months.</p>

<p><i>September 8.</i>&mdash;Your tide rolls on with terrifying rapidity,
at least I tremble while committing myself to it. You look
to me, and I to Sabat; and Sabat I look upon as the staff
of Egypt. May I prove mistaken! All, however, does
not depend upon him. If my life is spared, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
reason why the Arabic should not be done in Arabia, and
the Persian in Persia, as well as the Indian in India. I hope
your Shalome has not left you. I promise myself great
advantage in reading Hebrew and Syriac with him.</p>

<p><i>September 9.</i>&mdash;Yours of the 27th ult. is a heart-breaking
business. Though I share so deeply in Sabat&rsquo;s disgrace, I
feel more for you than myself, but I can give you no comfort
except by saying, &lsquo;It is well that it was in thine heart.&rsquo;
Your letter will give a new turn to my life. Henceforward
I have done with India. Arabia shall hide me till I come
forth with an approved New Testament in Arabic. I do
not ask your advice, because I have made up my mind, but
shall just wait your answer to this, and come down to you
instantly. I have been calculating upon the means of
support, and find that I shall have wherewithal to live.
Besides, the Lord will provide. Before Him I have spread
this affair, and do not feel that I shall be acting contrary
to His will.... Will Government let me go away for three
years before the time of my furlough arrives? If not, I
must quit the service, and I cannot devote my life to a more
important work than that of preparing the Arabic Bible.</p>

<p>Herewith you will receive the first seven chapters in
Persian and Hindustani, though I suppose you have ceased
to wish for them. The Persian will only prove that Sabat
is not the man for it. I have protested against many things
in it, but instead of sending you my objections I inclose a
critique by Mirza, who must remain unknown. I am somewhat
inclined to think the Arabic not quite so hopeless.
Sabat is confident, and eager to meet his opponents. His
version of the Romans was certainly not from the old one,
because he translated it all before my face from the
English; but then, as I hinted long ago, he is inaccurate
and not to be depended upon. He entirely approves of my
going to Busrah with his translations, and the old one,
confident that the decision there will be in his favour.
Dear Sir, take measures for transmitting me with the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
possible delay; detain me not, for the King&rsquo;s business
requires haste.</p></div>

<p>The King sent His eager servant to Persia, and did not
give him the desire of his heart to enter Arabia. Truly he
hastened so unrestingly that the Spirit of God led him to
complete the Persian New Testament, and then carried him
away from the many tongues of mortal men, which as they
sprang from disunion, so they are to &lsquo;cease&rsquo; in the one
speech of the multitudes of every nation and kindred and
tribe and tongue who sing the new song.</p>

<p>The following letter to Charles Simeon, the original of
which was presented by his biographer, Canon Carus, to
Canon Moor, who permits it to be published here for the
first time, fitly introduces Henry Martyn&rsquo;s translation used
in Persia. Simeon received it on January 21, 1812, and
thus wrote of it to Thomason:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From whom, think you, did I receive a letter yesterday?
From our beloved Martyn in Persia. He begins to find his
strength improve, and he is &lsquo;disputing daily&rsquo; with the
learned, who, he says, are extremely subtile. They are not
a little afraid of him, and are going to write a book on the
evidences of their religion. The evidences of Mohammedanism!
A fine comparison they will make with those of
Christianity. Oh, that God may endue our brother with
wisdom and strength to execute all that is in his heart. He
is desirous of spending two years in Persia, and is willing to
sacrifice his salary if the East India Company will not give
him leave. I am going in an hour to Mr. Grant to consult

<p>My dearest Friend and Brother,&mdash;My last letter to
you was from Bombay. I sailed thence on March 25, in
the Company&rsquo;s corvette, the Benares. As the ship was
manned principally by Europeans, I had a good deal
to do during the voyage, but through the mercy of our
Heavenly Father I was so far from suffering that I rather
gained strength, and am now apparently as well as ever I
was. On Easter day we made the coast of Mekran, in
Persia, and on the Sunday following landed at Muscat, in
Arabia. Here I met with an African slave, who tried hard
to persuade me that I was in the wrong and he in the
right. The dispute ended in his asking for an Arabic
Testament, which I gave him. We were about a month in
the Persian Gulf, generally in sight of land. At last, on
May 22, I was set down at Bushire, in Persia, and was
kindly received by the English Resident. One day I went
to the Armenian church, at the request of the priest, not
expecting to see anything like Christian worship, and
accordingly I did not. The Word of God was read, indeed,
but in such a way that no man could have understood it.
After church he desired me to notice that he had censed
me <i>four</i> times because I was a priest. This will give you
an idea of their excessive childishness. I took occasion
from his remark to speak about the priest&rsquo;s office, and the
awful importance of it. Nothing can be conceived more
vapid and inane than his observations.</p>

<p>As soon as my Persian dress was ready, I set off for
the interior in a kafila, or small caravan, consisting chiefly of
mules, and after a very fatiguing journey of ten days over
the mountains, during which time the difference in the
thermometer by day and night was often sixty degrees, I
arrived at this place about a month ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>I had no intention of making any stay here, but I found,
on my producing Sabat&rsquo;s Persian translation, that I must
sit down with native Persians to begin the work once more.
The fault found with Sabat&rsquo;s work is that he uses words
not only so difficult as to be unintelligible to the generality,
but such as never were in use in the Persian.</p>

<p>When it is considered that the issue of all disputes with
the Mohammedans is a reference to the Scriptures, and
that the Persian and Arabic are known all over the
Mohammedan world, it will be evident that we ought to
spare no pains in obtaining good versions in these languages.
Hence I look upon my staying here for a time as
a duty paramount to every other, and I trust that the
Government in India will look upon it in the same light.
If they should stop my pay, it would not alter my purpose
in the least, but it would be an inconvenience. I should
be happy, therefore, if the Court of Directors would sanction
my residence in these parts for a year or two. No one
who has been in Persia will imagine that I am here for my
own pleasure. India is a paradise to it. All is poverty
and desolation without, and within I have no comfort but
in my God. I am in the midst of enemies, who argue
against the truth, sometimes with uncommon subtlety.
But I pray for the fulfilment of the Lord&rsquo;s promise, and I
am assured that He will be with me and give me a mouth
and a wisdom, which all my adversaries shall not be able
to gainsay or resist. I am sometimes asked whether I am
not afraid to speak so boldly against the Mohammedan religion.
I tell them if I say or do anything against the laws
I am not unwilling to suffer, but if I say nothing but what
naturally comes in the course of argument&mdash;it is an argument
too which you yourselves began&mdash;why should I fear?
You know the power of the English too well to suppose
that they would let any violence be offered to me with
impunity.</p>

<p>The English ambassador, Sir Gore Ouseley, whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
met here on his way to Tabreez, carried me with him to the
court of the prince, who, though tributary to his father, is a
sovereign prince in Elam, as the S. Scriptures call the province
of Fars. He has also recommended me to the prince&rsquo;s
favourite minister, so that I am in no danger. But there
is certainly a great stir among the learned, and every effort
is made to support their cause. They have now persuaded
the father of all the moollas to write a book in Arabic on
the evidences of the Mohammedan religion, a book which
is to silence me for ever. I rather suppose that the more
their cause is examined the worse it will appear.</p>

<p>I have had no news from India these four months, so
I can say nothing of our friends there. Let your next
letters be sent not to India, but direct to Persia, in this
way: Rev. H.M., care of Sir Gore Ouseley, Bart., Ambassador
Extraordinary, etc., <i>Teheran</i>; care of S. Morier, Esq.,
<i>Constantinople</i>; care of George Moore, Esq., <i>Malta</i>. My
kindest love to all your dear people, Messrs. Bowman
and Goodall, Farish, Port, Phillips, etc. I hope they
continue to remember me once a week in their prayers;
to the <i>four godly professors</i>;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> to your young men though
to me unknown, and especially to your brother. Believe
me to be yours ever most affectionately,</p>

<p><i>1812, January 1</i> to <i>8</i>.&mdash;Spared by mercy to see the
beginning of another year. The last has been in some
respects a memorable year; transported in safety to Shiraz,
I have been led, by the particular providence of God, to
undertake a work the idea of which never entered my
mind till my arrival here, but which has gone on without
material interruption and is now nearly finished. To all
appearance the present year will be more perilous than any
I have seen, but if I live to complete the Persian New
Testament, my life after that will be of less importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>

<p>He had just before written this pathetic letter, of
exquisite friendliness:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To the Rev. D. Corrie</span>
</p>

Shiraz: December 12, 1811.
</p>

<p>Dearest Brother,&mdash;Your letters of January 28 and
April 22 have just reached me. After being a whole year
without any tidings of you, you may conceive how much
they have tended to revive my spirits. Indeed, I know not
how to be sufficiently thankful to our God and Father for
giving me a brother who is indeed a brother to my soul,
and thus follows me with affectionate prayers wherever I
go, and more than supplies my place to the precious flock
over whom the Holy Ghost hath made us overseers. There
is only one thing in your letters that makes me uneasy, and
that is, the oppression you complain of in the hot weather.
As you will have to pass another hot season at Cawnpore,
and I do not know how many more, I must again urge you
to spare yourself. I am endeavouring to learn the true use
of time in a new way, by placing myself in idea twenty or
thirty years in advance, and then considering how I ought
to have managed twenty or thirty years ago. In racing
violently for a year or two, and then breaking down? In
this way I have reasoned myself into contentment about
staying so long at Shiraz. I thought at first, what will the
Government in India think of my being away so long, or
what will my friends think? Shall I not appear to all a
wandering shepherd, leaving the flock and running about
for my own pleasure! But placing myself twenty years on
in time, I say, Why could not I stay at Shiraz long enough
to get a New Testament done there, even if I had been
detained there on that account three or six years? What
work of equal importance can ever come from me? So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
that now I am resolved to wait here till the New Testament
is finished, though I incur the displeasure of Government, or
even be dismissed the service. I have been many times
on the eve of my departure, as my translator promised to
accompany me to Baghdad, but that city being in great
confusion he is afraid to trust himself there; so I resolved
to go westward through the north of Persia, but found it
impossible, on account of the snow which blocks up the
roads in winter, to proceed till spring. Here I am
therefore, for three months more; our Testament will be
finished, please God, in six weeks. I go on as usual, riding
round the walls in the morning, and singing hymns at night
over my milk and water, for tea I have none, though I much
want it. I am with you in spirit almost every evening, and
feel a bliss I cannot describe in being one with the dear
saints of God all over the earth, through one Lord and one
Spirit.</p>

<p>They continued throwing stones at me every day, till
happening one day to tell Jaffir Ali Khan, my host, how
one as big as my fist had hit me in the back, he wrote to
the Governor, who sent an order to all the gates, that if any
one insulted me he should be bastinadoed, and the next
day came himself in state to pay me a visit. These
measures have had the desired effect; they now call me the
Feringhi Nabob, and very civilly offer me the kalean; but
indeed the Persian commonalty are very brutes; the
Soofis declare themselves unable to account for the fierceness
of their countrymen, except it be from the influence of
Islam. After speaking in my praise one of them added
&lsquo;and there are the Hindus too (who have brought the
guns), when I saw their gentleness I was quite charmed
with them; but as for our Iranees, they delight in nothing
but tormenting their fellow creatures.&rsquo; These Soofis are
quite the Methodists of the East. They delight in everything
Christian, except in being exclusive. They consider
that all will finally return to God, from whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
emanated, or rather of whom they are only different forms.
The doctrine of the Trinity they admired, but not the
atonement, because the Mohammedans, they say, consider
Imam Husain as also crucified for the sins of men; and to
everything Mohammedan they have a particular aversion.
Yet withal they conform externally. From these, however,
you will perceive the first Persian Church will be formed,
judging after the manner of men. The employment of my
leisure hours is translating the Psalms into Persian. What
will poor Fitrut do when he gets to the poetical books?
Job, I hope, you have let him pass over. The Books of
Solomon are also in a very sorry condition in the English.
The Prophets are all much easier, and consequently better
done. I hear there is a man at Yezd that has fallen into
the same way of thinking as myself about the letters, and
professes to have found out all the arts and sciences from
them. I should be glad to compare notes with him. It is
now time for me to bid you good night. We have had ice
on the pools some time, but no snow yet. They build their
houses without chimneys, so if we want a fire we must
take the smoke along with it. I prefer wrapping myself
in my sheepskin.</p>

<p>Your accounts of the progress of the kingdom of God
among you are truly refreshing. Tell dear H. and the
men of both regiments that I salute them much in the Lord,
and make mention of them in my prayers. May I continue
to hear thus of their state, and if I am spared to see them
again, may we make it evident that we have grown in grace.
Affectionate remembrances to your sister and Sherwoods;
I hope they continue to prosecute their labours of love.
Remember me to the people of Cawnpore who inquire,
etc. Why have not I mentioned Col. P.? It is not
because he is not in my heart, for there is hardly a man
in the world whom I love and honour more. My most
Christian salutations to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit, dearest brother. Yours affectionately,</p>

<span class="smcap">H. Martyn.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Martyn&rsquo;s Cambridge Persian studies were continued
for practical Hindustani purposes at Dinapore, in 1809,
and the following incident unconsciously lights up his
Persian scholarship at that date. Writing to the impatient
David Brown at Aldeen, from Patna, on March 28, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You chide me for not trusting my Hindustani to the
press. Last week we began the correction of it; present,
a Sayyid of Delhi, a poet of Lucknow, three or four
literates of Patna, and Baba Ali in the chair; Sabat and
myself assessors.</p>

<p>I was amazed and mortified at observing that reference
was had to the Persian for every verse, in order to understand
the Hindustani. It was, however, a consolation to
find that from the Persian they caught the meaning of it
instantly, always expressing their admiration of the plainness
of their translation.</p></div>

<p>But when the Persian translation of the four Gospels
was printed at Serampore, nearly two years after, Martyn
himself was dissatisfied with it. His Cawnpore and
especially Lucknow experience had developed him in
Persian style, and led him to see that in Persia itself only
could the great work be done of translating the Word of
God into a language spoken and read from Calcutta and
Patna to Damascus and Tabreez.</p>

<p>When Henry Martyn did the noblest achievement of
his life, the production of the Persian New Testament, he
unknowingly linked himself with the greatest of the Greek
Fathers, near whose dust his own was about to be laid.
Until the Eastern Church ceased to be aggressive&mdash;that is,
missionary&mdash;Persia, like Central Asia up to China itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
promised to be all Christian. Islam, a corrupted mixture
of Judaism and Christianity, took its place. Persia sent
a bishop to the Council of Nicæa in 325, and the great
Constantine wrote a letter to King Sapor, recommending
to his protection the Christian Churches in his empire.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Chrysostom (347-407), in his second homily on John,
incidentally tells us that &lsquo;the Persians, having translated
the doctrines of the Gospel into their own tongue, had
learned, though barbarians, the true philosophy.&rsquo; In his
homily on the memorial of Mary he puts the Persians first,
and our British forefathers last, in this remarkable passage:
&lsquo;The Persians, the Indians, Scythians, Thracians, Sarmatians,
the race of the Moors, and the inhabitants of the
British Isles, celebrate a deed performed in a private family
in Judea by a woman that had been a sinner.&rsquo; The isles
of Britain, Claudius Buchanan well remarks, then last, are
now the first to restore this memorial to the Persians as
well as to other Mohammedan nations. Even so late as
1740 the tyrant Nadir Shah, inquiring as to Jesus Christ,
asked for a Persian copy of the Gospels, and had presented
to him the combined work of an ignorant Romish priest
and some Mohammedan moollas, which excited his ridicule.
The traveller, Jonas Hanway, tells us that when Henry
Martyn saw this production he exclaimed that he did not
wonder at Nadir&rsquo;s contempt of it.</p>

<p>Martyn arrived in Shiraz on June 11, 1811; in a week
he began his Persian translation of the New Testament,
and in February 1812 he completed the happy toil, carried
on amidst disputations with Soofis and Shi&rsquo;ahs, Jews and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
Christians of the Oriental rites, while consumption wasted
his body. His &lsquo;leisure&rsquo; he spent in translating the Hebrew
Psalter. Let us look at him, in that South Persian summer
and winter and summer again, now in the city of Shiraz,
now driven by the sultry heat to the garden of roses and
orange-trees outside the walls near the tomb of Hafiz. The
Christian poet has pictured the scene&mdash;Alford, when Dean
of Canterbury in 1851. Twenty years after, he himself was
laid in the churchyard of the mother church of England,
St. Martin&rsquo;s, under this inscription&mdash;&lsquo;Diversorium Viatoris
Hierosolymam Proficiscentis&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Rev. David Brown</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
Shiraz: June 24, 1811.
</p>

<p>Dearest Sir,&mdash;I believe I told you that the advanced
state of the season rendered it necessary to go to Arabia
circuitously by way of Persia. Behold me therefore in the
Athens of Fars, the haunt of the Persian man. Beneath
are the ashes of Hafiz and Sadi; above, green gardens
and running waters, roses and nightingales. Does Mr. Bird
envy my lot? Let him solace himself with Aldeen. How
gladly would I give him Shiraz for Aldeen; how often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
while toiling through this miserable country have I sighed
for Aldeen! If I am ever permitted to see India again
nothing but dire necessity, or the imperious call of duty,
will ever induce me to travel again. One thing is good
here, the fruit; we have apples and apricots, plums,
nectarines, greengages and cherries, all of which are served
up with ice and snow. When I have said this for Shiraz
I have said all.</p>

<p>But to have done with what grows out of the soil, let
us come to the men. The Persians are, like ourselves,
immortal; their language had passed a long way beyond
the limits of Iran. The men of Shiraz propose to translate
the New Testament with me. Can I refuse to stay?
After much deliberation I have determined to remain here
six months. It is sorely against my will, but I feel it to
be a duty. From all that I can collect there appears no
probability of our ever having a good translation made out
of Persia. At Bombay I showed Moolla Firoz, the most
learned man there, the three Persian translations, viz. the
Polyglot, and Sabat&rsquo;s two. He disapproved of them all.
At Bushire, which is in Persia, the man of the greatest
name was Sayyid Hosein. Of the three he liked Sabat&rsquo;s
Persian best, but said it seemed written by an Indian. On
my arrival at this place I produced my specimens once
more. Sabat&rsquo;s Persian was much ridiculed; sarcastic remarks
were made on the fondness for fine words so
remarkable in the Indians, who seemed to think that hard
words made fine writing. His Persic also was presently
thrown aside, and to my no small surprise the old despised
Polyglot was not only spoken of as superior to the rest,
but it was asked, What fault is found in this?&mdash;this is the
language we speak. The king has also signified that it is
his wish that as little Arabic as possible may be employed
in the papers presented to him. So that simple Persian is
likely to become more and more fashionable. This is a
change favourable certainly to our glorious cause. To the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
poor the Gospel will be preached. We began our work
with the Gospel of St. John, and five chapters are put out
of hand. It is likely to be the simplest thing imaginable;
and I dare say the pedantic Arab will turn up his nose at
it; but what the men of Shiraz approve who can gainsay?
Let Sabat confine himself to the Arabic, and he will
accomplish a great work. The forementioned Sayyid
Hosein of Bushire is an Arab. I showed him Erpenius&rsquo;s
Arabic Testament, the Christian Knowledge Society, Sabat&rsquo;s,
and the Polyglot. After rejecting all but Sabat&rsquo;s, he said
this is good, very good, and then read off the 5th of
Matthew in a fine style, giving it unqualified commendation
as he went along. On my proposing to him to give a
specimen of what he thought the best Persian style, he
consented; but, said he, give me this to translate from,
laying his hand on Sabat&rsquo;s Arabic. At Muscat an Arab
officer who had attended us as guard and guide one day
when we walked into the country, came on board with his
slave to take leave of us. The slave, who had argued with
me very strenuously in favour of his religion, reminded me
of a promise I had made him of giving him the Gospel.
On my producing an Arabic New Testament, he seized it
and began to read away upon deck, but presently stopped,
and said it was not fine Arabic. However, he carried off
the book.</p></div>

<p>In eight months the Persian translation of the New
Testament was done. The <i>Journal</i>, during that period,
from July 1811 to February 1812, as the sacred task went
on, reveals the Holy Spirit moving the hearts of the
translator&rsquo;s Mohammedan assistant and Soofi disputants by
&lsquo;the things of Christ,&rsquo; while it shows His servant bearing
witness, by the account of his own conversion, to His power
to save and to make holy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><i>December 12.</i>&mdash;Letters at last from India. Mirza Sayyid
Ali was curious to know in what way we corresponded,
and made me read Mr. Brown&rsquo;s letter to me, and mine to
Corrie. He took care to let his friends know that we
wrote nothing about our own affairs: it was all about
translations and the cause of Christ. With this he was
delighted.</p>

<p><i>December 16.</i>&mdash;In translating 2 Cor. i. 22, &lsquo;Who hath
given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts,&rsquo; he was much
struck when it was explained to him. &lsquo;Oh, that I had it,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;have you received it?&rsquo; I told him that, as I had
no doubt of my acceptance through Christ, I concluded that
I had. Once before, on the words, &lsquo;Who are saved?&rsquo; he
expressed his surprise at the confidence with which Christians
spoke of salvation. On 1 Cor. xv. he observed,
that the doctrine of the resurrection of the body was unreasonable;
but that as the Mohammedans understood
it, it was impossible; on which account the Soofis rejected
it.</p>

<p><i>Christmas Day.</i>&mdash;I made a great feast for the Russians
and Armenians; and, at Jaffir Ali Khan&rsquo;s request, invited
the Soofi master, with his disciples. I hoped there would
be some conversation on the occasion of our meeting, and,
indeed, Mirza Sayyid Ali did make some attempts, and explained
to the old man the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper;
but the sage maintaining his usual silence, the subject was
dropped. I expressed my satisfaction at seeing them assembled
on such an occasion, and my hope that they would
remember the day in succeeding years, and that though
they would never see me again in the succeeding years,
they would not forget that I had brought them the Gospel.
The old man coldly replied that &lsquo;God would guide those
whom He chose.&rsquo; Most of the time they continued was
before dinner; the moment that was despatched, they rose
and went away. The custom is, to sit five or six hours
before dinner, and at great men&rsquo;s houses singers attend.</p>

<p><i>December 31.</i>&mdash;The accounts of the desolations of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
during the last year, which I have been reading in some
Indian newspapers, make the world appear more gloomy
than ever. How many souls hurried into eternity unprepared!
How many thousands of widows and orphans left
to mourn! But admire, my soul, the matchless power of
God, that out of this ruin He has prepared for Himself an
inheritance. At last the scene shall change, and I shall
find myself in a world where all is love.</p>

<p><i>1812.</i>&mdash;The last has been in some respects a memorable
year. I have been led, by what I have reason to consider
as the particular providence of God, to this place; and have
undertaken an important work, which has gone on without
material interruption, and is now nearly finished. I like to
find myself employed usefully, in a way I did not expect
or foresee, especially if my own will is in any degree
crossed by the work unexpectedly assigned me, as
there is then reason to believe that God is acting. The
present year will probably be a perilous one, but my life is
of little consequence, whether I live to finish the Persian
New Testament or do not. I look back with pity and
shame upon my former self, and on the importance I then
attached to my life and labours. The more I see of my
own works the more I am ashamed of them. Coarseness
and clumsiness mar all the works of man. I am sick when
I look at man and his wisdom and his doings, and am
relieved only by reflecting that we have a city whose
builder and maker is God. The least of <i>His</i> works it is
refreshing to look at. A dried leaf or a straw makes me
feel myself in good company: complacency and admiration
take place of disgust.</p>

<p>I compared with pain our Persian translation with the
original; to say nothing of the precision and elegance of
the sacred text, its perspicuity is that which sets at defiance
all attempts to equal it.</p>

<p><i>January 16.</i>&mdash;Mirza Sayyid Ali told me accidentally
to-day of a distich made by his friend Mirza Koochut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
at Teheran, in honour of a victory gained by Prince Abbas
Mirza over the Russians. The sentiment was, that he had
killed so many of the Christians, that Christ, from the
fourth heaven, took hold of Mahomet&rsquo;s skirt to entreat
him to desist. I was cut to the soul at this blasphemy.
In prayer I could think of nothing else but that great day
when the Son of God shall come in the clouds of heaven,
taking vengeance on them that know not God, and convincing
men of all their hard speeches which they have
spoken against Him.</p>

<p>Mirza Sayyid Ali perceived that I was considerably
disordered, and was sorry for having repeated the verse,
but asked what it was that was so offensive. I told him
that &lsquo;I could not endure existence if Jesus was not
glorified; it would be hell to me if He were to be always
thus dishonoured.&rsquo; He was astonished, and again asked
why. &lsquo;If anyone pluck out your eyes,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;there is
no saying <i>why</i> you feel pain; it is feeling. It is because I
am one with Christ that I am thus dreadfully wounded.&rsquo;
On his again apologising, I told him that &lsquo;I rejoiced at what
had happened, inasmuch as it made me feel nearer the Lord
than ever. It is when the head or heart is struck, that
every member feels its membership.&rsquo; This conversation
took place while we were translating. In the evening he
mentioned the circumstance of a young man&rsquo;s being murdered&mdash;a
fine athletic youth, whom I had often seen in the
garden. Some acquaintance of his in a slight quarrel had
plunged a dagger in his breast. Observing me look
sorrowful, he asked why. &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;he was cut off
in his sins, and had no time to repent.&rsquo; &lsquo;It was just in that
way,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I should like to die; not dragging out
a miserable existence on a sick-bed, but transported at once
into another state.&rsquo; I observed that &lsquo;it was not desirable
to be hurried into the immediate presence of God.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do
you think,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that there is any difference in the
presence of God here or there?&rsquo; &lsquo;Indeed I do,&rsquo; said I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
&lsquo;Here we see through a glass darkly; but there, face to
face.&rsquo; He then entered into some metaphysical Soofi disputation
about the identity of sin and holiness, heaven and
hell: to all which I made no reply.</p>

<p><i>January 18.</i>&mdash;Aga Ali of Media came: and with him
and Mirza Ali I had a long and warm discussion about the
essentials of Christianity. The Mede, seeing us at work
upon the Epistles, said, &lsquo;he should be glad to read them; as
for the Gospels they were nothing but tales, which were of
no use to him; for instance,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if Christ raised four
hundred dead to life, what is that to me?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it
certainly was of importance, for His work furnished a reason
for our depending upon His words.&rsquo; &lsquo;What did He say,&rsquo;
asked he, &lsquo;that was not known before? the love of God,
humility&mdash;who does not know these things?&rsquo; &lsquo;Were these
things,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;known before Christ, either among Greeks
or Romans, with all their philosophy?&rsquo; They avowed that
the Hindu book <i>Juh</i> contained precepts of this kind. I
questioned its antiquity; &lsquo;but however that may be,&rsquo; I
added, &lsquo;Christ came not to <i>teach</i> so much as to <i>die</i>; the
truths I spoke of as confirmed by His miracles were those
relating to His person, such as, &ldquo;Come unto Me, all ye that
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; Here
Mirza Sayyid Ali told him that I had professed to have no
doubt of my salvation. He asked what I meant. I told
him, &lsquo;that though sin still remained, I was assured that it
should not regain dominion; and that I should never come
into condemnation, but was accepted in the Beloved.&rsquo; Not
a little surprised, he asked Mirza Sayyid Ali whether he comprehended
this. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;nor Mirza Ibrahim, to
whom I mentioned it.&rsquo; The Mede again turning to me
asked, &lsquo;How do you know this? how do you know you
have experienced the second birth?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;we have the Spirit of the Father; what He wishes we
wish; what He hates we hate.&rsquo; Here he began to be
a little more calm and less contentious, and mildly asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
how I had obtained this peace of mind: &lsquo;Was it merely
these books?&rsquo; said he, taking up some of our sheets. I told
him, &lsquo;These books, with prayer.&rsquo; &lsquo;What was the beginning
of it,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the society of some friends?&rsquo; I related to him
my religious history, the substance of which was, that I took
my Bible before God in prayer, and prayed for forgiveness
through Christ, assurance of it through His Spirit, and grace
to obey His commandments. They then both asked whether
the same benefit would be conferred on them. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;for so the Apostles preached, that all who were baptized
in His name should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Can you assure me,&rsquo; said Mirza Sayyid Ali, &lsquo;that the Spirit
will be given to me? if so, I will be baptized immediately.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Who am I that I should be surety?&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I bring
you this message from God, that he who, despairing of
himself, rests for righteousness on the Son of God, shall
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; and to this I can add
my testimony, if that be worth anything, that I have found
the promise fulfilled in myself. But if after baptism you
should not find it so in you, accuse not the Gospel of falsehood.
It is possible that your faith might not be sincere;
indeed, so fully am I persuaded that you do not believe on
the Son of God, that if you were to entreat ever so earnestly
for baptism I should not dare to administer it at this
time, when you have shown so many signs of an unhumbled
heart.&rsquo; &lsquo;What! would you have me believe,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;as
a child?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;True,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I think that is
the only way.&rsquo; Aga Ali said no more, except, &lsquo;Certainly
he is a good man!&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>January 23.</i>&mdash;Put on my English dress, and went to
the Vizier&rsquo;s, to see part of the tragedy of Husain&rsquo;s death,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
which they contrive to spin out so as to make it last the
first ten days of the Mohurrum. All the apparatus consisted
of a few boards for a stage, two tables and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
a pulpit, under an immense awning, in the court where
the company were assembled. The <i>dramatis personæ</i>
were two; the daughter of Husain, whose part was performed
by a boy, and a messenger; they both read their
parts. Every now and then loud sobs were heard all over
the court. After this several feats of activity were
exhibited; the Vizier sat with the moollas. I was appointed
to a seat where indeed I saw as much as I wanted,
but which, I afterwards perceived, was not the place of
honour. As I trust I am far enough from desiring the
chief seats in the synagogues, there was nothing in this
that could offend me; but I do not think it right to let
him have another opportunity of showing a slight to my
country in my person.</p>

<p><i>January 24.</i>&mdash;Found Sayyid Ali rather serious this evening.
He said he did not know what to do to have his
mind made up about religion. Of all the religions Christ&rsquo;s
was the best; but whether to prefer this to Soofi-ism he
could not tell. In these doubts he is tossed to and fro, and
is often kept awake the whole night in tears. He and his
brother talk together on these things till they are almost
crazed. Before he was engaged in this work of translation,
he says he used to read about two or three hours a day,
now he can do nothing else; has no inclination for anything
else, and feels unhappy if he does not correct his daily
portion. His late employment has given a new turn to his
thoughts as well as to those of his friends; they had not
the most distant conception of the contents of the New
Testament. He says his Soofi friends are exceedingly
anxious to see the Epistles, from the accounts he gives of
them, and also he is sure that almost the whole of Shiraz
are so sensible of the load of unmeaning ceremonies in
which their religion consists, that they will rejoice to see
or hear of anything like freedom, and that they would be
more willing to embrace Christ than the Soofis, who, after
taking so much pains to be independent of all law, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
think it degrading to submit themselves to any law again,
however light.</p>

<p><i>February 2.</i>&mdash;From what I suffer in this city, I can
understand the feelings of Lot. The face of the poor
Russian appears to me like the face of an angel, because
he does not tell lies. Heaven will be heaven because
there will not be one liar there. The Word of God is more
precious to me at this time than I ever remember it to have
been; and of all the promises in it, none is more sweet to
me than this&mdash;&lsquo;He shall reign till He hath put all enemies
under His feet.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>February 3.</i>&mdash;A packet arrived from India without a
single letter for me. It was some disappointment to me:
but let me be satisfied with my God, and if I cannot have
the comfort of hearing from my friends, let me return with
thankfulness to His Word, which is a treasure of which
none envy me the possession, and where I can find what
will more than compensate for the loss of earthly enjoyments.
Resignation to the will of God is a lesson which I
must learn, and which I trust He is teaching me.</p>

<p><i>February 9.</i>&mdash;Aga Boozong came. After much conversation,
he said, &lsquo;Prove to me, from the beginning, that
Christianity is the way: how will you proceed? what do
you say must be done?&rsquo; &lsquo;If you would not believe a
person who wrought a miracle before you,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have
nothing to say; I cannot proceed a step.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will grant
you,&rsquo; said Sayyid Ali, &lsquo;that Christ was the Son of God, and
more than that.&rsquo; &lsquo;That you despair of yourself, and are
willing to trust in Him alone for salvation?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;And
are ready to confess Christ before men, and act conformably
to His Word?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes: what else must I do?&rsquo; &lsquo;Be baptized
in the name of Christ.&rsquo; &lsquo;And what shall I gain?&rsquo; &lsquo;The
gift of the Holy Ghost. The end of faith is salvation in
the world to come; but even here you shall have the
Spirit to purify your heart, and to give you the assurance
of everlasting happiness.&rsquo; Thus Aga Boozong had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
opportunity of hearing those strange things from my own
mouth, of which he had been told by his disciple the Mede.
&lsquo;You can say too,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that you have received the
Spirit?&rsquo; I told them I believed I had; &lsquo;for, notwithstanding
all my sins, the bent of my heart was to God in a way it
never was before; and that, according to my present feeling,
I could not be happy if God was not glorified, and if I had
not the enjoyment of His presence, for which I felt that I
was now educating.&rsquo; Aga Boozong shed tears.</p>

<p>After this came Aga Ali, the Mede, to hear, as he said,
some of the sentences of Paul. Mirza Sayyid Ali had
told them, &lsquo;that if they had read nothing but the Gospels,
they knew nothing of the religion of Christ.&rsquo; The sheet I
happened to have by me was the one containing the fourth,
fifth, and sixth chapters of the Second Epistle to the
Corinthians, which Aga Ali read out.</p>

<p>At this time the company had increased considerably.
I desired Aga Ali to notice particularly the latter part of
the fifth chapter, &lsquo;God was in Christ, reconciling the world
unto Himself.&rsquo; He then read it a second time, but they
saw not its glory; however, they spoke in high terms of
the pith and solidity of Paul&rsquo;s sentences. They were evidently
on the watch for anything that tallied with their
own sentiments. Upon the passage, &lsquo;Always bearing
about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,&rsquo; the Mede
observed, &lsquo;Do you not see that Jesus was in Paul, and that
Paul was only another name for Jesus?&rsquo; And the text,
&lsquo;Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God; and whether
we be sober, it is for your sakes,&rsquo; they interpreted thus:
&lsquo;We are absorbed in the contemplation of God, and when
we recover, it is to instruct you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Walking afterwards with Mirza Sayyid Ali, he told me
how much one of my remarks had affected him, namely,
that he had no humility. He had been talking about
simplicity and humility as characteristic of the Soofis.
&lsquo;Humility!&rsquo; I said to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span> &lsquo;if you were humble, you would
not dispute in this manner; you would be like a child.&rsquo;
He did not open his mouth afterwards, but to say, &lsquo;True;
I have no humility.&rsquo; In evident distress, he observed,
&lsquo;The truth is, we are in a state of compound ignorance&mdash;ignorant,
yet ignorant of our ignorance.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>February 18.</i>&mdash;While walking in the garden, in some
disorder from vexation, two Mussulman Jews came up and
asked me what would become of them in another world.
The Mahometans were right in their way, they supposed,
and we in ours, but what must they expect? After
rectifying their mistake as to the Mahometans, I mentioned
two or three reasons for believing that we are right: such
as their dispersion, and the cessation of sacrifices immediately
on the appearance of Jesus. &lsquo;True, true,&rsquo; they said,
with great feeling and seriousness; indeed, they seemed
disposed to yield assent to anything I said. They confessed
they had become Mahometans only on compulsion, and
that Abdoolghuni wished to go to Baghdad, thinking he
might throw off the mask there with safety, but they
asked what I thought. I said that the Governor was a
Mahometan. &lsquo;Did I think Syria safer?&rsquo; &lsquo;The safest
place in the East,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;was India.&rsquo; Feelings of pity for
God&rsquo;s ancient people, and having the awful importance of
eternal things impressed on my mind by the seriousness
of their inquiries as to what would become of them, relieved
me from the pressure of my comparatively insignificant
distresses. I, a poor Gentile, blest, honoured, and loved;
secured for ever by the everlasting covenant, whilst the
children of the kingdom are still lying in outer darkness!
Well does it become me to be thankful!</p>

<p>This is my birthday, on which I complete my thirty-first
year. The Persian New Testament has been begun,
and I may say finished in it, as only the last eight chapters
of the Revelation remain. Such a painful year I never
passed, owing to the privations I have been called to on
the one hand, and the spectacle before me of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
depravity on the other. But I hope that I have not come
to this seat of Satan in vain. The Word of God has found
its way into Persia, and it is not in Satan&rsquo;s power to oppose
its progress if the Lord hath sent it.</p></div>

<p>A week after, on February 24, 1812, Henry Martyn
corrected the last page of the New Testament in Persian.
As we read his words of thanksgiving to the Lord and his
invocation of the Holy Spirit, in the already darkening
light of his approaching end, before the beatific vision promised
by the Master to the pure in heart, and the blessed
companionship with Himself guaranteed to every true
servant, we recall the Scottish Columba, whose last act
was to transcribe the eleventh verse of the thirty-fourth
Psalm, and the English Bede, who died when translating
the ninth verse of the sixth chapter of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have many mercies for which to thank the Lord, and
this is not the least. Now may that Spirit who gave the
Word, and called me, I trust, to be an interpreter of it,
graciously and powerfully apply it to the hearts of sinners,
even to the gathering an elect people from amongst the
long-estranged Persians!</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="subheading">SHIRAZ TO TABREEZ&mdash;THE PERSIAN NEW TESTAMENT</p>


<p>The next three months were spent, still in Shiraz, in the
preparation of copies of the precious Persian MS. of the
New Testament, and in very close spiritual intercourse
with the company of inquirers whom neither fanaticism,
conceit, nor, in some cases, a previously immoral life, had
prevented from reverencing the teaching of the man of
God. Jaffir Ali Khan&rsquo;s garden became to such a holy place,
as the Persian spring passed into the heat of summer.
There the privileged translator, Mirza Sayyid Ali; Aga Baba,
the Mede; Aga Boozong, vizier of Prince Abbas Mirza, and
&lsquo;most magisterial of the Soofis;&rsquo; Mirza Ibrahim, the
controversialist leader; Sheikh Abulhassan, and many a
moolla to whom he testified that Christ was the Creator
and Saviour, gathered round him as he read, &lsquo;at their
request,&rsquo; the Old Testament histories. &lsquo;Their attention
to the Word, and their love and attention to me, seemed
to increase as the time of my departure approached.
Aga Baba, who had been reading St. Matthew, related
very circumstantially to the company the particulars of
the death of Christ. The bed of roses on which we sat,
and the notes of the nightingales warbling around us, were
not so sweet to me as this discourse from the Persian.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>Telling Mirza Sayyid Ali one day that I wished to return
to the city in the evening, to be alone and at leisure for
prayer, he said with seriousness, &lsquo;Though a man had no
other religious society I suppose he might, with the aid of
the Bible, live alone with God?&rsquo; This solitude will, in one
respect, be his own state soon;&mdash;may he find it the medium
of God&rsquo;s gracious communications to his soul! He asked
in what way God ought to be addressed: I told him as a
Father, with respectful love; and added some other exhortations
on the subject of prayer.</p>

<p><i>May 11.</i>&mdash;Aga Baba came to bid me farewell, which
he did in the best and most solemn way, by asking, as a
final question, &lsquo;whether, independently of external evidences,
I had any internal proofs of the doctrine of Christ?&rsquo;
I answered, &lsquo;Yes, undoubtedly: the change from what I
once was is a sufficient evidence to me.&rsquo; At last he took
his leave, in great sorrow, and what is better, apparently in
great solicitude about his soul.</p>

<p>The rest of the day I continued with Mirza Sayyid Ali,
giving him instructions what to do with the New Testament
in case of my decease, and exhorting him, as far as his
confession allowed me, to stand fast. He had made many
a good resolution respecting his besetting sins. I hope,
as well as pray, that some lasting effects may be seen at
Shiraz from the Word of God left among them.</p></div>

<p>For the Shah and for the heir-apparent, Prince Abbas
Mirza, two copies of the Persian New Testament were
specially written out in the perfect caligraphy which the
Persians love, and carefully corrected with the translator&rsquo;s
own hand. That he might himself present them, especially
the former, he left Shiraz on May 11, 1812, after a year&rsquo;s
residence in the country. The whole length of the great
Persian plateau had to be traversed, by Ispahan to Teheran,
thence to the royal camp at Sultania, and finally to Tabreez,
where was Sir Gore Ouseley, the British ambassador, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
whom alone the English man of God could be introduced to
the royal presence. He was accompanied by Mr. Canning,
an English clergyman.</p>

<p>The journey occupied eight weeks, and proved to be
one of extreme hardship, which rapidly developed Henry
Martyn&rsquo;s disease. At one time his life was in danger, in
spite of the letters which he carried from General Malcolm&rsquo;s
friend, and now his own, Jaffir Ali Khan, to the Persian
prime minister at Teheran. Mrs. Bishop&rsquo;s experience of
travel by the same road<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> at a more favourable season, over
the &lsquo;great mud land&rsquo; to which centuries of misrule have
changed the populous paradise of Darius, enables us to
imagine what the brief record of the <i>Journal</i> only half
reveals seventy years ago. The old village which
the founder of the Kajar dynasty enlarged into Teheran,
straggles within eleven miles of walls in the most depressed
part of an uninteresting waste. Save for the
exterior of the Shah&rsquo;s palace, and those of some of his
ministers, the suburb with the European legations, and
now the large and handsome buildings of the American
Presbyterian Mission, it is unworthy of being a capital
city. Eager to present the sacred volume while life was
left to him, Henry Martyn hurried away to find Mirza
Shufi, the premier, and the Shah, who were in camp a
night&rsquo;s journey off at Karach.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>May 13.</i>&mdash;Remained all day at the caravanserai, correcting
the Prince&rsquo;s copy.</p>

<p><i>May 14.</i>&mdash;Continued our journey through two ridges
of mountains to Imanzadu: no cultivation to be seen anywhere,
nor scarcely any natural vegetable production, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
the broom and hawthorn. The weather was rather tempestuous,
with cold gusts of wind and rain. We were
visited by people who came to be cured of their distempers.</p>

<p><i>May 16.</i>&mdash;We found a hoar frost, and ice on the
pools. The excessive cold at this place is accounted for
by its being the highest land between the Persian Gulf and
the Caspian Sea. The baggage not having come up, we
were obliged to pass another day in this uncomfortable
neighbourhood, where nothing was to be procured for ourselves
or our horses, the scarcity of rain this year having
left the ground destitute of verdure, and the poor people of
the village near us having nothing to sell.</p>

<p><i>May 21.</i>&mdash;Finished the revision of the Prince&rsquo;s copy.
At eleven at night we started for Ispahan, where we
arrived soon after sunrise on the 22nd, and were accommodated
in one of the king&rsquo;s palaces. Found my old
Shiraz scribe here, and corrected with him the Prince&rsquo;s
copy.</p>

<p><i>May 23.</i>&mdash;Called on the Armenian bishops at Julfa,
and met Matteus. He is certainly vastly superior to any
Armenian I have yet seen. We next went to the Italian
missionary, Joseph Carabiciate, a native of Aleppo, but
educated at Rome. He spoke Latin very sprightly, considering
his age, which was sixty-six, but discovered no
sort of inclination to talk about religion. Until lately he
had been supported by the Propaganda; but weary at last
of exercising his functions without remuneration, and even
without the necessary provision, he talked of returning to
Aleppo.</p>

<p><i>May 24.</i> (Sunday.)&mdash;Went early this morning to the
Armenian church attached to the episcopal residence.
Within the rails were two out of the four bishops, and
other ecclesiastics, but in the body of the church only
three people. Most of the Armenians at Julfa, which is
now reduced to five hundred houses, attended at their re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>spective
parish churches, of which there are twelve, served
by twenty priests. After their pageantry was over, and we
were satisfied with processions, ringing of bells, waving of
colours, and other ceremonies, which were so numerous as
entirely to remove all semblance of spiritual worship, we
were condemned to witness a repetition of the same
mockery at the Italian&rsquo;s church, at his request. I could
not stand it out, but those who did observed that the
priest ate and drank all the consecrated elements himself,
and gave none to the few poor women who composed his
congregation, and who, the Armenian said, had been hired
for the occasion.</p>

<p>Before returning to Ispahan we sat a short time in
the garden with the bishops. They, poor things, had
nothing to say, and could scarcely speak Persian; so that
all the conversation was between me and Matteus. At
my request he brought what he had of the Holy Scriptures
in Persian and Arabic. They were Wheloi&rsquo;s Persian
Gospels, and an Arabic version of the Gospels printed at
Rome. I tried in vain to bring him to any profitable
discussion; with more sense than his brethren, he is not
more advanced in spiritual knowledge. Returned much
disappointed. Julfa had formerly twenty bishops and
about one hundred clergy, with twenty-four churches.</p>

<p><i>June 2.</i>&mdash;Soon after midnight we mounted our horses.
It was a mild moonlight night and a nightingale filled the
whole valley with his notes. Our way was along lanes,
over which the wood on each side formed a canopy, and
a murmuring rivulet accompanied us till it was lost in a
lake. At daylight we emerged into the plain of Kashan,
which seems to be a part of the great Salt Desert. On
our arrival at the king&rsquo;s garden, where we intended to
put up, we were at first refused admittance, but an application
to the Governor was soon attended to. We saw
here huge snowy mountains on the north-east beyond
Teheran.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p><i>June 5.</i>&mdash;Reached Kum;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the country uniformly desolate.
The chief Moojtahid in all Persia, being a resident
of this city, I sent to know if a visit would be agreeable
to him. His reply was, that if I had any business with
him I might come; but if otherwise, his age and infirmities
must be his excuse. Intending to travel a double stage,
started soon after sunset.</p>

<p><i>June 8.</i>&mdash;Arrived, two hours before daybreak, at the
walls of Teheran. I spread my bed upon the high road, and
slept till the gates were open; then entered the city, and
took up my abode at the ambassador&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>I lost no time in forwarding Jaffir Ali Khan&rsquo;s letter to
the premier, who sent to desire that I would come to him.
I found him lying ill in the verandah of the king&rsquo;s tent of
audience. Near him were sitting two persons, who, I was
afterwards informed, were Mirza Khantar and Mirza
Abdoolwahab; the latter being a secretary of state and
a great admirer of the Soofi sage. They took very little
notice, not rising when I sat down, as is their custom to
all who sit with them; nor offering me kalean. The two
secretaries, on learning my object in coming, began a
conversation with me on religion and metaphysics, which
lasted two hours. As they were both well-educated,
gentlemanly men, the discussion was temperate, and, I
hope, useful.</p>

<p><i>June 12.</i>&mdash;I attended the Vizier&rsquo;s levée, where there
was a most intemperate and clamorous controversy kept
up for an hour or two; eight or ten on one side, and I on
the other. Amongst them were two moollas, the most
ignorant of any I have yet met with in either Persia or
India. It would be impossible to enumerate all the absurd
things they said. Their vulgarity in interrupting me in
the middle of a speech; their utter ignorance of the nature
of an argument; their impudent assertions about the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
and the Gospel, neither of which they had ever seen in
their lives, moved my indignation a little. I wished, and I
said it would have been well, if Mirza Abdoolwahab had
been there; I should then have had a man of sense to
argue with. The Vizier, who set us going at first, joined
in it latterly, and said, &lsquo;You had better say God is God,
and Muhammad is the prophet of God.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;God is
God,&rsquo; but added, instead of &lsquo;Muhammad is the prophet of
God,&rsquo; &lsquo;and Jesus is the Son of God.&rsquo; They had no sooner
heard this, which I had avoided bringing forward till then,
than they all exclaimed, in contempt and anger, &lsquo;He is
neither born nor begets,&rsquo; and rose up, as if they would
have torn me in pieces. One of them said, &lsquo;What will
you say when your tongue is burnt out for this blasphemy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>One of them felt for me a little, and tried to soften the
severity of this speech. My book, which I had brought
expecting to present it to the king, lay before Mirza Shufi.
As they all rose up after him to go, some to the king and
some away, I was afraid they would trample on the book;
so I went in among them to take it up, and wrapped it in
a towel before them, while they looked at it and me with
supreme contempt. Thus I walked away alone in my tent,
to pass the rest of the day in heat and dirt. What have
I done, thought I, to merit all this scorn? Nothing, I trust,
but bearing testimony to Jesus. I thought over these
things in prayer, and my troubled heart found that peace
which Christ hath promised to His disciples.</p>

<p>To complete the trials of the day, a message came from
the Vizier in the evening, to say that it was the custom of
the king not to see any Englishman, unless presented
by the ambassador, or accredited by a letter from him,
and that I must, therefore, wait till the king reached
Sultania, where the ambassador would be.</p>

<p><i>June 13.</i>&mdash;Disappointed of my object in coming to
the camp, I lost no time in leaving it, and proceeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
company with Mr. Canning, who had just joined me from
Teheran, towards Kasbin, intending there to wait the result
of an application to the ambassador. Started at eleven,
and travelled till eleven next morning, having gone ten
parasangs or forty miles, to Quishlang. The country all
along was well watered and cultivated. The mules being
too much tired to proceed, we passed the day at the
village; indeed, we all wanted rest. As I sat down in the
dust, on the shady side of a walled village by which we
passed, and surveyed the plains over which our road lay,
I sighed at the thought of my dear friends in India and
England, of the vast regions I must traverse before I can
get to either, and of the various and unexpected hindrances
which present themselves to my going forward. I comfort
myself with the hope that my God has something for me
to do, by thus delaying my exit.</p>

<p><i>June 22.</i>&mdash;We met with the usual insulting treatment
at the caravanserai, where the king&rsquo;s servants had got
possession of a good room, built for the reception of the
better order of guests; they seemed to delight in the
opportunity of humbling an European. Sultania is still
but a village, yet the Zengan prince has quartered himself
and all his attendants, with their horses, on this poor little
village. All along the road, where the king is expected,
the people are patiently waiting, as for some dreadful
disaster; plague, pestilence, or famine is nothing to the
misery of being subject to the violence and extortion of
this rabble soldiery.</p>

<p><i>June 25.</i> (Zengan.)&mdash;After a restless night, rose so ill
with the fever that I could not go on. My companion,
Mr. Canning, was nearly in the same state. We touched
nothing all day.</p>

<p><i>June 26.</i>&mdash;After such another night I had determined
to go on, but Mr. Canning declared himself unable to stir,
so here we dragged through another miserable day. What
added to our distress was that we were in danger, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
detained here another day or two, of being absolutely in
want of the necessaries of life before reaching Tabreez.
We made repeated applications to the moneyed people, but
none would advance a piastre. Where are the people who
flew forth to meet General Malcolm with their purses and
their lives? Another generation is risen up, &lsquo;who know
not Joseph.&rsquo; Providentially a poor muleteer, arriving from
Tabreez, became security for us, and thus we obtained five
tomans. This was a heaven-send; and we lay down
quietly, free from apprehensions of being obliged to go a
fatiguing journey of eight or ten hours, without a house or
village in the way, in our present weak and reduced state.
We had now eaten nothing for two days. My mind was
much disordered from head-ache and giddiness, from
which I was seldom free; but my heart, I trust, was with
Christ and His saints. To live much longer in this world
of sickness and pain seemed no way desirable; the most
favourite prospects of my heart seemed very poor and
childish; and cheerfully would I have exchanged them all
for the unfading inheritance.</p>

<p><i>June 27.</i>&mdash;My Armenian servant was attacked in the
same way. The rest did not get me the things that I
wanted, so that I passed the third day in the same
exhausted state; my head, too, was tortured with shocking
pains, such as, together with the horror I felt at being
exposed to the sun, showed me plainly to what to ascribe
my sickness. Towards evening, two more of our servants
were attacked in the same way, and lay groaning from
pains in the head.</p>

<p><i>June 28.</i>&mdash;All were much recovered, but in the afternoon
I again relapsed. During a high fever Mr. Canning
read to me in bed the Epistle to the Ephesians, and I
never felt the consolations of that Divine revelation of
mysteries more sensibly and solemnly. Rain in the night
prevented our setting off.</p>

<p><i>June 29.</i>&mdash;My ague and fever returned, with such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
head-ache that I was almost frantic. Again and again I
said to myself, &lsquo;Let patience have her perfect work,&rsquo; and
kept pleading the promises, &lsquo;When thou passest through
the waters I will be with thee,&rsquo; etc.; and the Lord did not
withhold His presence. I endeavoured to repel all the
disordered thoughts that the fever occasioned, and to keep
in mind that all was friendly; a friendly Lord presiding;
and nothing exercising me but what would show itself
at last friendly. A violent perspiration at last relieved
the acute pain in my head, and my heart rejoiced;
but as soon as that was over, the exhaustion it occasioned,
added to the fatigue from the pain, left me in
as low a state of depression as ever I was in. I seemed
about to sink into a long fainting fit, and I almost wished
it; but at this moment, a little after midnight, I was
summoned to mount my horse, and set out, rather dead
than alive. We moved on six parasangs. We had a
thunder-storm with hail.</p>

<p><i>July 1.</i>&mdash;A long and tiresome march to Sarehund; in
seven parasangs there was no village. They had nothing
to sell but buttermilk and bread; but a servant of Abbas
Mirza, happening to be at the same caravanserai, sent us
some flesh of a mountain cow which he had shot the day
before. All day I had scarcely the right recollection of
myself from the violence of the ague. We have now
reached the end of the level ground which we have had all
the way from Teheran, and are approaching the boundaries
of Parthia and Media; a most natural boundary it is, as
the two ridges of mountains we have had on the left and
right come round and form a barrier.</p>

<p><i>July 2.</i>&mdash;At two in the morning we set out. I hardly
know when I have been so disordered. I had little or no
recollection of things, and what I did remember at times
of happy scenes in India or England, served only to
embitter my present situation. Soon after removing into
the air I was seized with a violent ague, and in this state I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
went on till sunrise. At three parasangs and a half we
found a fine caravanserai, apparently very little used, as the
grass was growing in the court. There was nothing all
round but the barren rocks, which generally roughen the
country before the mountain rears its height. Such an
edifice in such a situation was cheering. Soon after we
came to a river, over which was a high bridge; I sat down
in the shade under it, with two camel drivers. The kafila,
as it happened, forded the river, and passed on without my
perceiving it. Mr. Canning seeing no signs of me, returned,
and after looking about for some time, espied my horse
grazing; he concluded immediately that the horse had
flung me from the bridge into the river, and was almost
ready to give me up for lost. My speedy appearance from
under the bridge relieved his terror and anxiety. Half the
people still continue ill; for myself, I am, through God&rsquo;s
infinite mercy, recovering.</p>

<p><i>July 4.</i>&mdash;I so far prevailed as to get the kafila into
motion at midnight. Lost our way in the night, but
arriving at a village we were set right again. At eight
came to Kilk caravanserai, but not stopping there, went
on to a village, where we arrived at half-past nine. The
baggage not coming up till long after, we got no breakfast
till one o&rsquo;clock. In consequence of all these things, want
of sleep, want of refreshment, and exposure to the sun, I
was presently in a high fever, which raged so furiously all
the day that I was nearly delirious, and it was some time
before I could get the right recollection of myself. I
almost despaired, and do now, of getting alive through this
unfortunate journey. Last night I felt remarkably well,
calm and composed, and sat reflecting on my heavenly
rest, with more sweetness of soul, abstraction from the
world, and solemn views of God, than I have had for a
long time. Oh, for such sacred hours! This short and
painful life would scarcely be felt could I live thus at
heaven&rsquo;s gate. It being impossible to continue my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
journey in my present state, and one of the servants also
being so ill that he could not move with safety, we determined
to halt one day at the village, and sent on a
messenger to Sir Gore, at Tabreez, informing him of our
approach.</p>

<p><i>July 5.</i>&mdash;As soon as it was day we found our way to
the village where the Doctor was waiting for us. Not being
able to stay for us, he went on to Tabreez, and we as far
as Wasmuch, where he promised to procure for us a fine
upper room furnished; but when we arrived, they denied
that there was any such a place. At last, after an hour&rsquo;s
threatening, we got admittance to it. An hour before
break of day I left it, in hopes of reaching Tabreez before
sunrise. Some of the people seemed to feel compassion for
me, and asked me if I was not very ill. At last I reached
the gate, and feebly asked for a man to show me the way
to the ambassador&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><i>July 9.</i>&mdash;Made an extraordinary effort, and as a Tartar
was going off instantly to Constantinople, wrote letters to
Mr. Grant for permission to come to England, and to Mr.
Simeon and Lydia, informing them of it; but I have
scarcely the remotest expectation of seeing it, except
by looking at the almighty power of God.</p>

<p>Dined at night at the ambassador&rsquo;s, who said he was
determined to give every possible <i>éclat</i> to my book, by
presenting it himself to the king. My fever never ceased
to rage till the 21st, during all which time every effort was
made to subdue it, till I had lost all my strength and
almost all my reason. They now administer bark, and it
may please God to bless the tonics; but I seem too far
gone, and can only say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span> &lsquo;having a desire to depart and be
with Christ, which is far better.&rsquo;</p>

</p>

<p>My dearest Lydia,&mdash;I have only time to say that I
have received your letter of February 14. Shall I pain
your heart by adding, that I am in such a state of sickness
and pain, that I can hardly write to you? Let me rather
observe, to obviate the gloomy apprehension my letters to
Mr. Grant and Mr. Simeon may excite, that I am likely
soon to be delivered from my fever. Whether I shall gain
strength enough to go on, rests on our Heavenly Father, in
whose hands are all my times. Oh, His precious grace!
His eternal unchanging love in Christ to my soul never
appeared more clear, more sweet, more strong. I ought to
inform you that in consequence of the state to which I am
reduced by travelling so far overland, without having half
accomplished my journey, and the consequent impossibility
of returning to India the same way, I have applied for
leave to come on furlough to England. Perhaps you will
be gratified by this intelligence; but oh, my dear Lydia,
I must faithfully tell you that the probability of my
reaching England alive is but small; and this I say, that
your expectations of seeing me again may be moderate, as
mine are of seeing you. Why have you not written more
about yourself? However, I am thankful for knowing
that you are alive and well. I scarcely know how to
desire you to direct. Perhaps Alexandria in Egypt will
be the best place; another may be sent to Constantinople,
for though I shall not go there, I hope Mr. Morier will be
kept informed of my movements. Kindest love to all the
saints you usually mention. Yours ever most faithfully
and affectionately,</p>

</p>

<p>My dearest Friend and Brother,&mdash;The Tartar courier
for Constantinople, who has been delayed some days on
our account, being to be despatched instantly, my little
strength also being nearly exhausted by writing to Mr.
Grant a letter to be laid before the court: I have only to
notice some of the particulars of your letter of February of
this year. It is not now before me, neither have I strength
to search for it among my papers; but from the frequent
attentive perusals I gave it during my intervals of ease, I
do not imagine that any of it has escaped my memory.
At present I am in a high fever, and cannot properly
recollect myself. I shall ever love and be grateful to Mr.
Thornton for his kind attention to my family.</p>

<p>The increase of godly young men is precious news.
If I sink into the grave in India, my place will be supplied
an hundredfold. You will learn from Mr. Grant that I
have applied for leave to come to England on furlough; a
measure you will disapprove; but you would not, were
you to see the pitiable condition to which I am reduced,
and knew what it is to traverse the continent of Asia in
the destitute state in which I am. If you wish not to
see me, I can say that I think it most probable that you
will not; the way before me being not better than that
passed over, which has nearly killed me.</p>

<p>I would not pain your heart, my dear brother, but we
who are in Jesus have the privilege of viewing life and
death as nearly the same, since both are one; and I thank
a gracious Lord that sickness never came at a time when
I was more free from apparent reasons for living. Nothing
seemingly remains for me to do but to follow the rest of
my family to the tomb. Let not the book written against
Muhammadanism be published till approved in India. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
European who has not lived amongst them cannot imagine
how differently they see, imagine, reason, object, from
what we do. This I had full opportunity of observing
during my eleven months&rsquo; residence at Shiraz. During
that time I was engaged in a written controversy with one
of the most learned and temperate doctors there. He
began. I replied what was unanswerable, then I subjoined
a second more direct attack on the glaring absurdities of
Muhammadanism, with a statement of the nature and
evidences of Christianity. The Soofis then as well as
himself desired a demonstration, from the very beginning,
of the truth of any revelation. As this third treatise
contained an examination of the doctrine of the Soofis, and
pointed out that their object was attainable by the Gospel,
and by that only, it was read with interest and convinced
many. There is not a single Europeanism in the whole
that I know of, as my friend and interpreter would not
write anything that he could not perfectly comprehend.
But I am exhausted; pray for me, beloved brother, and
believe that I am, as long as life and recollection lasts,
yours affectionately,</p>

<p>My dearest Brother and Friend,&mdash;Ever since I wrote,
about a month, I believe, I have been lying upon the bed
of sickness; for twenty days or more the fever raged with
great violence, and for a long time every species of medicine
was tried in vain. After I had given up every hope of
recovery, it pleased God to abate the fever, but incessant
head-aches succeeded, which allowed me no rest day or
night. I was reduced still lower, and am now a mere
skeleton; but as they are now less frequent, I suppose it to
be the will of God that I should be raised up to life again.
I am now sitting in my chair, and wrote the will with a
strong hand; but as you see I cannot write so now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Kindest love to Mr. John Thornton, for whose temporal
and spiritual prosperity I daily pray.&mdash;Your ever affectionate
friend and brother,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">H. Martyn.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Lydia Grenfell&rsquo;s letter, to which Martyn&rsquo;s of July 12,
written in such circumstances, is a reply, was really dated
February 1, 1812, and was the last received from her by
him. Her <i>Diary</i> notes that she &lsquo;wrote to India, August 30,
September 30, 1812&rsquo;; and on December 12 of that year,
thus remarks on his letter of July 12:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Heard from Tabreez from Mr. Martyn with an account
of his dangerous state of health and intention of returning
to England if his life was spared. This intelligence affected
me variously. The probability of his death, the certainty
of his extreme sufferings, and distance from every friend,
pressed heavily on my spirits; I was enabled to pray, and
felt relieved. Of his return no very sanguine expectations
can be entertained. Darkness and distress of mind have
followed this information. I cannot collect my thoughts
to write, or apply as I ought to anything. Oh, let me
consider this as a call to prayer and watchfulness and self-examination.
Lord, assist me!</p>

<p><i>December 16.</i>&mdash;A season of great temptation, darkness,
and distress. At no period of my life have I stood more
in need of Divine help, and oh! may I earnestly seek it.
Lord, I would pray, give me a right understanding, and
enable me seriously to consider and weigh in the balance of
the sanctuary all I do&mdash;yea, let my thoughts be watched.
Sleep has fled from mine eyes, and a fearful looking for of
trial and affliction, however this affair ends, possesses my
mind. Oh! let me cast my burden on the Lord&mdash;it is too
heavy for me. Lord, let me begin afresh to call upon Thy
name, and, taking hold of Thee, I shall be borne up above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
my trials, carried through the difficulties I see before me,
and be delivered.</p>

<p><i>December 17.</i>&mdash;I desire, O Thou blessed God, to seek
Thy face, to call on Thy name. Thou hast been my
refuge; I have been happy in the sense of Thy love. With
all my sins, my weaknesses and miseries, I come to Thee,
and most seriously would I seek Thy guidance in the perplexing
and difficult circumstances I am in. O Lord, suffer
me not to run counter to Thy will nor to dishonour Thee.</p>

<p><i>December 25.</i>&mdash;Bless the Lord, O my soul; bless His
holy name for ever and ever. I sought the Lord in my
distress, and He gave ear unto me. Gracious and merciful
art Thou, O Lord, for Thou didst bend Thine ear to the
most worthless of all creatures. This is for the glory of
Thy name alone, to show how great Thy mercy is, how
sure Thy truth. After a night of clouds and darkness,
behold the clear sky.</p>

<p><i>December 26.</i>&mdash;This joyful, holy season calls upon me
for fresh praises, and a renewed dedication of myself to
God. I rejoice in believing Christ was born; I rejoice in
the end proposed of His appearance in the flesh, the
recovery of mankind to holiness and to God. I welcome
this salvation as that I most desire. My happiness, I know,
consists in holiness and in the favour of God. Thought
much to-day of my dear friend. I cannot think of him as
having gained the heavenly crown, but as struggling with
dangers and difficulties. Secure in them all of Thy favour,
and defended by Thy power, he is safe, and pass but a few
years or days, and he will enter into the rest of God. Let
me, too, follow after him as he follows Christ.</p>

<p><i>1813, January 4.</i>&mdash;After a night and day spent in great
conflict and agony of mind, I, this evening, enjoy a respite
from distressing apprehensions. I was reduced to the
lowest, as to animal spirits and spiritual life, when it
occurred to me I would go to the meeting, where I found
a sweet&mdash;oh, may it be a lasting! relief from my cares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
Having better things proposed for my consideration, my
burden has chiefly been from a sense of inward weakness
and a conviction of having lost the presence of God. The
state of my beloved friend less occupies my mind than I
sometimes think is reconcilable with a true affection for
him; but the truth is, the concerns of my soul are the more
pressing. Oh! may this trial truly answer this purpose of
driving me to God, my refuge and rest.</p>

<p><i>January 6.</i>&mdash;Still harassed and without strength to
resist. I seem divested of the Spirit, yet, oh, let me not
give way to this! I will try, as a helpless sinner, to seek
Divine aid. Thou canst command peace within and increase
my faith. I am amazed at the state of my mind&mdash;instead
of having my thoughts exercised about my dear friend, I
am filled with distressing fears for my soul, and left so to
myself that all I can do is to pray for the Lord to return
and lift upon me the light of His countenance. O Thou
blessed Redeemer! hear my sighs and put my tears into
Thy bottle. My wanderings are noted down in Thy book.
Oh, have pity on my wretched state and revive Thy work,
increase my faith. Thou art the resurrection and the life&mdash;let
me rest on this Scripture.</p>

<p><i>February 1.</i>&mdash;My beloved friend remembered every hour,
but to-day with less distressing fears and perplexity of mind.
I do from my inmost soul, O Lord, desire Thy will to be
done, and that Thou mayest be glorified in this concern.
Oh, direct us!</p>

<p><i>February 7.</i>&mdash;I have been convinced to-day how by
admitting into my heart, and suffering my first, my last,
and every thought to be engrossed by an earthly object, I
have grieved the Holy Spirit, and hindered God from
dwelling in me. Oh! let me have done with idols and
worship God.</p></div>

<p>More than six weeks after his letter of July 12, the
fever-stricken missionary recovered strength to write to
Lydia once again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="greeting">
<span class="smcap">To Lydia Grenfell</span>
</p>
<p class="date">
Tabreez: August 28, 1812.<br />
</p>

<p>I wrote to you last, my dear Lydia, in great disorder.
My fever had approached nearly to delirium, and my
debility was so great that it seemed impossible I could
withstand the power of disease many days. Yet it has
pleased God to restore me to life and health again; not
that I have recovered my former strength yet, but consider
myself sufficiently restored to prosecute my journey. My
daily prayer is, that my late chastisement may have its
intended effect, and make me all the rest of my days more
humble, and less self-confident. Self-confidence has often
let me down fearful lengths, and would, without God&rsquo;s
gracious interference, prove my endless perdition. I seem
to be made to feel this evil of my heart more than any
other at this time. In prayer, or when I write or converse
on the subject, Christ appears to me my life and strength,
but at other times I am as thoughtless and bold as if I had
all life and strength in myself, Such neglect on our part
works a diminution of our joys; but the covenant, the
covenant! stands fast with Him, for His people evermore.</p>

<p>I mentioned my conversing sometimes on Divine subjects,
for though it is long enough since I have seen a child
of God, I am sometimes led on by the Persians to tell them
all I know of the very recesses of the sanctuary, and these
are the things that interest them. But to give an account
of all my discussions with these mystic philosophers must
be reserved to the time of our meeting. Do I dream, that
I venture to think and write of such an event as that? Is
it possible that we shall ever meet again below? Though
it is possible, I dare not indulge such a pleasing hope yet.
I am still at a tremendous distance; and the countries I
have to pass through are many of them dangerous to the
traveller, from the hordes of banditti, whom a feeble govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>ment
cannot chastise. In consequence of the bad state of
the road between this and Aleppo, Sir Gore advises me to
go first to Constantinople, and from thence to pass into
Syria. In favour of this route, he urges that, by writing
to two or three Turkish Governors on the frontiers, he can
secure me a safe passage, at least half-way, and the latter
half is probably not much infested. In three days, therefore,
I intend setting my horse&rsquo;s head towards Constantinople,
distant above thirteen hundred miles. Nothing, I
think, will occasion any further detention here, if I can
procure servants who know both Persian and Turkish;
but should I be taken ill on the road, my case would be
pitiable indeed. The ambassador and his suite are still
here: his and Lady Ouseley&rsquo;s attentions to me, during my
illness, have been unremitted. The Prince Abbas Mirza,
the wisest of the king&rsquo;s sons, and heir to the throne, was
here some time after my arrival; I much wished to present
a copy of the Persian New Testament to him, but I could
not rise from my bed. The book will, however, be given
to him by the ambassador. Public curiosity about the
Gospel, now for the first time, in the memory of the modern
Persians, introduced into the country, is a good deal excited
here, at Shiraz, and other places; so that, upon the whole,
I am thankful for having been led hither and detained,
though my residence in this country has been attended
with many unpleasant circumstances. The way of the
kings of the East is preparing. This much may be said
with safety, but little more. The Persians also will
probably take the lead in the march to Zion, as they are
ripe for a revolution in religion as well as politics.</p>

<p>Sabat, about whom you inquire so regularly, I have
heard nothing of this long time. My friends in India have
long since given me up as lost or gone out of reach, and if
they wrote they would probably not mention him, as he is
far from being a favourite with any of them. <span class="dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who is
himself of an impatient temper, cannot tolerate him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
indeed, I am pronounced to be the only man in Bengal
who could have lived with him so long. He is, to be sure,
the most tormenting creature I ever yet chanced to deal
with&mdash;peevish, proud, suspicious, greedy; he used to give
daily more and more distressing proofs of his never having
received the saving grace of God. But of this you will say
nothing; while his interesting story is yet fresh in the
memory of people, his failings had better not be mentioned.
The poor Arab wrote me a querulous epistle from Calcutta,
complaining that no one took notice of him now that I
was gone; and then he proceeds to abuse his best friends.
I have not yet written to reprove him for his unchristian
sentiments, and when I do I know it will be to no purpose
after all the private lectures I have given him. My course
from Constantinople is so uncertain that I hardly know
where to desire you to direct to me; I believe Malta is the
only place, for there I must stop in my way home. Soon
we shall have occasion for pen and ink no more; but I
trust I shall shortly see thee face to face. Love to all the
saints.</p>

<p>Believe me to be yours ever, most faithfully and
affectionately,</p>

<p>These were Henry Martyn&rsquo;s last words to Lydia Grenfell.
Hasting home to be with her, in a few weeks his
yearning spirit was with the Lord&mdash;</p>


<div class="poem">
<span class="i14">Love divine, all love excelling.
</span></div>

<p>Tabreez was at this time the centre of diplomatic
activity. While the Shah and his camp were not far off,
the Turkish Ambassador was in the city, and Sir Gore
Ouseley was busily mediating between the Turkish and
Persian Governments after their hostilities on the Baghdad
frontier. Turkey, moreover, had just before concluded a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
treaty with Russia, with consequences most offensive to
the Shah. Only the personal influence and active interference
of the British Ambassador prevented the renewal
of hostilities. Mr. Morier, the Secretary of Embassy, gives
us this contemporary picture of Martyn&rsquo;s arrival:<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> &lsquo;We
had not long been at Tabreez before our party was joined
by the Rev. William Canning and the Rev. Henry Martyn.
The former was attached to our Embassy as chaplain; the
latter, whom we had left at Shiraz employed in the translation
of the New Testament into the Persian language,
having completed that object, was on his way to Constantinople.
Both these gentlemen had suffered greatly in
health during their journey from Shiraz. Mr. Martyn had
scarcely time to recover his strength before he departed
again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Had Henry Martyn been induced by his hospitable
friends to rest here for a time, had the physician constrained
him to wait for a better season and more strength,
he might have himself presented his sacred work to the
Shah&mdash;might have repeated in the north what he had been
permitted to do in one brief year in the south of Persia,
and might have again seen the beloved Lydia and his
Cambridge friends. For Tabreez, &lsquo;the fever-dispeller,&rsquo; is
said to have been so named by Zobeidah, the wife of the
Kaliph Haroon&rsquo;r Rashheed, who, at the close of the eighth
century, beautified the ancient Tauris, capital of Tiridates
III., King of Armenia in 297, because of its healthy
climate. In spite of repeated earthquakes the city has
been always rebuilt, low and mean, covering an area like
that of Vienna, but the principal emporium from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
Persia used to receive its European goods till the coasting
steamers of India opened up the Persian Gulf and, of late,
the Euphrates, Tigris, and Karoon rivers. Only the ark, or
citadel of Ali Shah, a noble building of burnt brick, and
the fine ruin of the Kabood Masjeed, or mosque of beautifully
arabesqued blue tiles, redeemed the city in Martyn&rsquo;s
time from meanness. The Ambassador, his host, was then
lodged in the house of its wealthiest citizen, Hajji Khan
Muhammed, whom the Prince had turned out to make
room for Sir Gore Ouseley. Now the British Consulate of
Tabreez is a spacious residence, with a fine garden, and
the city has become flourishing again. Henry Martyn left
Tabreez on his fatal journey at the very time when the
climate began to be at its best. All around, too, and
especially in the hills of Sahand to the south, with the air
of Scotland and of Wales, or on the natural pastures of
Chaman, where the finest brood mares are kept, sloping
down to the waters of Lake Ooroomia, he would have
found in the hot season the loveliest land in Asia.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Before we hasten on with the modern apostle of the
Persians to the bitter but bright end, we must trace the
history of the influence of his translation of the New
Testament. The 20th August, 1812, he joyfully entered
in his <i>Journal</i> as a day much to be remembered for the
remarkable recovery of strength. He learned from Mirza
Aga Meer that his &lsquo;work,&rsquo; that is, his reply to Mirza
Ibrahim, had been read to the Shah by Mirza Abdoolwahab,
and that the king had observed to Mirza Boozong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
his son&rsquo;s vizier, that the Feringhis&rsquo; (Franks&rsquo;) Government
and army, and now one of their moollas, was come into the
East. The Shah then directed Mirza Boozong to prepare
an answer. In consequence of this information Sir Gore
Ouseley, who doubtless desired to spare the little strength
of his guest, directed that a certain moolla, who greatly
wished to be introduced to the man of God, should not
be brought to him. Nevertheless, &lsquo;one day a moolla came
and disputed a while for Muhammedan, but finished with
professing Soofi sentiments.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The great Shah, Fateh Ali Khan himself, and his son,
were thus prepared for the Divine gift of Henry Martyn in
due form through the British Ambassador. How it reached
His Persian Majesty from Sir Gore Ouseley, and how the
Shah-in-Shah received it, these letters tell, so honourable to
the writers, even after all allowance is made for the diplomatic
courtliness of the correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The Soofi controversialists
and friends of the translator, who by that time
had entered on his rest, must have, moreover, predisposed
the eclectic mind of the always liberal Shah to treat with
reverence the <i>Injil</i>, or Gospel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="greeting"><i>From His Excellency Sir Gore Ouseley, Bart., Ambassador
Extraordinary from His Britannic Majesty to the Court of

<p class="date">
St. Petersburg: September 20, 1814.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear Lord,&mdash;Finding that I am likely to be detained
here some six or seven weeks, and apprehensive that my
letters from Persia may not have reached your Lordship, I
conceive it my duty to acquaint you, for the information of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
the society of Christians formed for the purpose of propagating
the Sacred Writings, that, agreeably to the wishes
of our poor friend, the late Rev. Henry Martyn, I presented
in the name of the Society (as he particularly desired) a
copy of his translation of the New Testament into the
Persian language to His Persian Majesty, Fateh Ali Shah
Kajar, having first made conditions that His Majesty was
to peruse the whole, and favour me with his opinion of the
style, etc.</p>

<p>Previous to delivering the book to the Shah, I employed
transcribers to make some copies of it, which I distributed
to Hajji Mahomed Hussein Khan, Prince of Maru, Mirza
Abdulwahab, and other men of learning and rank immediately
about the person of the king, who, being chiefly
converts to the Soofi philosophy, would, I felt certain, give
it a fair judgment, and, if called upon by the Shah for
their opinion, report of it according to its intrinsic merits.</p>

<p>The enclosed translation of a letter from His Persian
Majesty to me will show your Lordship that he thinks the
complete work a great acquisition, and that he approves of
the simple style adopted by my lamented friend Martyn
and his able coadjutor, Mirza Sayyed Ali, so appropriate to
the just and ready conception of the sublime morality of
the Sacred Writings. Should the Society express a wish
to possess the original letter from the Shah, or a copy of it
in Persian, I shall be most happy to present either through
your Lordship.</p>

<p>I beg leave to add that, if a correct copy of Mr.
Martyn&rsquo;s translation has not yet been presented to the
Society, I shall have great pleasure in offering one that has
been copied from and collated with the original left with
me by Mr. Martyn, on which he had bestowed the greatest
pains to render it perfect.</p>

<p>I also promise to devote my leisure to the correction of
the press, in the event of your thinking proper to have
it printed in England, should my Sovereign not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
immediate occasion for my services out of England.&mdash;I
am, etc.</p>

<p class="greeting"><i>Translation of His Persian Majesty&rsquo;s Letter,
referred to in the preceding.</i><br />
In the Name of the Almighty God, whose glory is most
excellent.<br />
</p>

<p>It is our august command that the dignified and excellent
our trusty, faithful, and loyal well-wisher, Sir Gore Ouseley,
Baronet, His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Ambassador Extraordinary
(after being honoured and exalted with the expressions
of our highest regard and consideration), should
know that the copy of the Gospel, which was translated
into Persian by the learned exertions of the late
Rev. Henry Martyn, and which has been presented to
us by your Excellency on the part of the high, dignified,
learned, and enlightened Society of Christians, united for
the purpose of spreading abroad the Holy Books of the
religion of Jesus (upon whom, and upon all prophets, be
peace and blessings!), has reached us, and has proved highly
acceptable to our august mind.</p>

<p>In truth, through the learned and unremitted exertions
of the Rev. Henry Martyn, it has been translated in a
style most befitting sacred books, that is, in an easy and
simple diction. Formerly, the four Evangelists, Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John, were known in Persia; but now
the whole of the New Testament is completed in a most
excellent manner: and this circumstance has been an
additional source of pleasure to our enlightened and
august mind. Even the four Evangelists which were
known in this country had never been before explained in
so clear and luminous a manner. We, therefore, have been
particularly delighted with this copious and complete
translation. If it please the most merciful God, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
command the Select Servants, who are admitted to our
presence, to read<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> to us the above-mentioned book from the
beginning to the end, that we may, in the most minute
manner, hear and comprehend its contents.</p>

<p>Your Excellency will be pleased to rejoice the hearts
of the above-mentioned dignified, learned, and enlightened
Society with assurances of our highest regard and approbation;
and to inform those excellent individuals who are
so virtuously engaged in disseminating and making known
the true meaning and intent of the Holy Gospel, and other
points in sacred books, that they are deservedly honoured
with our royal favour. Your Excellency must consider
yourself as bound to fulfil this royal request.</p>

<p>Even here we see Martyn and Carey once more linked
together. The same volume from which we have taken
these letters contains, a few pages before them, these
words written by Dr. Carey from Serampore: &lsquo;Religion is
the only thing in the world worth living for. And no work
is so important as serving God in the Gospel of His Son;
if, like the Apostle, we do this with one spirit, great will be
our enjoyment and abundant our reward.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sir Gore Ouseley carried the original MS. to St. Petersburg,
where, happening to mention the fact to the President
of the Russian Bible Society, Prince Galitzin at once
begged that his Society, always an honourable exception
to the intolerance of the Tsar&rsquo;s Greek Church, might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
allowed to publish it. A set of Persian types was specially
procured. Sir Gore Ouseley, assisted by the Persian Jaffir
Khan, corrected the proofs, and the Rev. R. Pinkerton, one
of the Scottish Mission to Karass, carefully superintended
the printing. Several Persians, resident in that city, bespoke
copies for their friends. The British and Foreign Bible
Society granted 300<i>l.</i> towards the expenses of an edition
of 5,000 copies. The first edition appeared there in
September, 1815, on which Prince Galitzin wrote to Mr.
Pinkerton, as representing the Bible Society in London:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Praise be given to the incomprehensible counsels of
God, who, for the salvation of man, gave His Word, and
causeth it to increase among all nations: who useth as
His instruments the inhabitants of countries of different
languages and tribes, not unfrequently the most distant
from each other and altogether unacquainted with those
for whom they labour! This is a true sign of the holy
will of God respecting this work, who worketh all and in
all. This is the case with the finished edition of the
Persian New Testament, which was translated into that
language in a far distant part of Asia, and prepared to be
printed in another, but brought into Russia (where nothing
of the kind was ever thought of) and printed off much
sooner than was at first intended. Here men were found
endowed with good-will and the requisite qualifications for
the completion of this work, which at first seemed to be so
difficult.</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Martyn himself having directed that a copy
of the manuscript translation should be sent to Calcutta
from Shiraz, when he left that city, four copies were made,
lest any accident should befall it on the way to Bengal.
It reached the Calcutta Corresponding Committee in 1814,
and they invited Mirza Sayyid Ali to join them and pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
it through the press. This second edition accordingly
appeared at Calcutta in 1816. Professor Lee, of Cambridge,
published a third edition of it in London in 1827, and a
fourth in 1837. The most beautiful and valuable of all is
the fifth, now before the writer, which Thomas Constable
printed in Edinburgh in 1846 (corresponding to 1262 of
the <i>Hijrah</i>) in three royal octavo volumes. This was also
the most important because it accompanied a Persian
translation of the Old Testament. Mirza Sayyid Ali had
early informed the Calcutta Committee that he had his
master&rsquo;s original translation of the Psalter, and this also
appeared at Calcutta in 1816. This formed the nucleus
of the Persian Old Testament prepared by Dr. W. Glen,
of the Scottish Missionary Society&rsquo;s Mission, at Karass,
Astrakhan, and printed along with Henry Martyn&rsquo;s New
Testament in the memorable and beautiful Edinburgh
edition. That edition of the whole Bible was presented
by Dr. Glen to the present Shah of Persia, Nassr-ed-Deen,
on his accession to the throne in 1848. With Martyn&rsquo;s
New Testament His Majesty seemed to be well acquainted.
Of the volume containing the Old Testament we read that
&lsquo;on handing the book to the servant in waiting he just
kissed and then put it to his forehead, with the same indication
of reverence which he would have shown had
it been their own sacred book, the Koran.&rsquo; Archdeacon
Robinson, of Poona, published another Persian translation
of the Old Testament. The Church Missionary Society&rsquo;s
distinguished missionary at Julfa, Dr. Robert Bruce, has
been for years engaged on a revision, or rather new
translation of the Old Testament into Persian, the two
versions of which are far inferior, in the opinion of one
who is at the head of all living experts, to Henry Marty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>n&rsquo;s
translation of the New. Dr. Bruce&rsquo;s work has now been
completed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I know no parallel to these achievements of Henry
Martyn&rsquo;s, writes Canon W.J. Edmonds, closing a survey
of his powers and services as a translator of the Scriptures.
There are in him the things that mark the born translator.
He masters grammar, observes idioms, accumulates vocabulary,
reads and listens, corrects and even reconstructs.
Above all, he prays. He lives &lsquo;in the Spirit,&rsquo; and rises
from his knees full of the mind of the Spirit. Pedantry is
not in him, nor vulgarity. He longs and struggles to catch
the dialect in which men may speak worthily of the things
of God. And so his work lives. In his own Hindustani
New Testament, and in the recovered parts of the Old
Testament in which he watched over the labours of Fitrut,
his work is still a living influence; men find &lsquo;reasons for
reverting&rsquo; to it. His earlier Persian, and what is demonstrably
distinct from it, his Persic translation, or rather
Sabat&rsquo;s, done under his superintendence, these indeed have
gone. They did not survive his visit to Persia. Nor did
the Arabic, which was the chief acknowledged motive of
his journey. But what a gifted man is here, and what a
splendid sum total of work, that can afford these deductions
from the results of a five or six years&rsquo; struggle with illness,
and still leave behind translations of the New Testament
in Hindustani and in Persian; the Hindustani version
living a double life, its own and that which William Bowley
gave it in the humbler vocabulary of the Hindi villages!
We live in hurrying times; our days are swifter than a
shuttle. New names, new saints, new heroes ever rise and
dazzle the eyes of common men. So it should be, for God
lives, and through Him men live and manifest His unexhausted
power. But Martyn is a perennial. He springs
up fresh to every generation. It is time, though, to take
care that he does not become simply the shadow of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
angel passing by. His pinnacle is that lofty one which is
only assigned to eminent goodness, but it rests upon, and
is only the finial of, a broad-based tower of sound and
solid intellectual endowment.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s Persian Testament called forth, in
1816, two Bulls from Pope Pius VIII., addressed to the
Archbishops of Gnesne and Moghilev, within the Russian
dominions, and letters from the Propaganda College at Rome
to the Vicars Apostolic and Missionaries in Persia, Armenia,
and other parts of the East. Wherever the Persian language
was known the people were warned &lsquo;against a version
recently made into the Persian idiom.&rsquo; The Archbishops
were told &lsquo;that Bibles printed by heretics are numbered
among the prohibited books by the rules of the Index
(Nos. II. and III.), for it is evident, from experience, that
from the Holy Scriptures which are published in the vulgar
tongue, more injury than good has arisen through the
temerity of men.&rsquo; Bible Societies in Russia and Great
Britain are denounced as a &lsquo;most crafty device, by which
the very foundations of religion are undermined.&rsquo; So the
Latin Church has ever put from it &lsquo;The Great Missionary&rsquo;
which the Reformation was the first to restore to Christendom
and the world, and Henry Martyn gave to the
Mohammedans in their own tongue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="subheading">IN PERSIA AND TURKEY&mdash;TABREEZ TO TOKAT AND
THE TOMB</p>


<p>On the evening of September 2, 1812, Henry Martyn left
Tabreez for Constantinople, on what he describes as &lsquo;my
long journey of thirteen hundred miles.&rsquo; The route marked
out for him by Sir Gore Ouseley, who gave him letters to
the Turkish governors of Erivan, Kars, and Erzroom, and
to the British Minister at Constantinople, as well as to the
Armenian Patriarch and Bishop Nestus at Etchmiatzin, was
the old Roman road into Central Asia. Professor W.M.
Ramsay describes it as clearly marked by Nature,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and still
one of the most important trade routes. It was the safest
and speediest, as well as the least forbidding. &lsquo;Sir Gore,
wishing me not to travel in the same unprotected way I
had done, procured from the Prince a <i>mehmandar</i> for
me, together with an order for the use of <i>chappar</i> horses
all the way to Erivan.&rsquo; Thence he was passed on to
Kars similarly attended, and thence to Erzroom. He took
with him &lsquo;near three hundred <i>tomans</i> in money,&rsquo; or about
130<i>l.</i> On the eve of his departure he wrote:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span> &lsquo;The
delightful thought of being brought to the borders of
Europe, without sustaining any injury, contributed more
than anything else, I believe, to restore my health and
spirits.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But travelling in Persia and Asiatic Turkey, even at
the best and for the strongest, is necessarily a work of
hardship. The <i>chappar</i>, or post-stations, occur at a distance
of from twenty to twenty-five miles, measured by the
<i>farsakh</i>, the old parasang in Greek phrase, of four miles
each. What Mrs. Bishop has recently described has always
been true: &lsquo;The custom is to ride through all the hours
of daylight, whenever horses are to be got, doing from
sixty to ninety miles a day.&rsquo; Henry Martyn rode his own
horses, and his party of two Armenian servants (a groom
and Turkish interpreter), with the <i>mehmandar</i>, had the
post-horses. Out of the cities he had to trust, for rest and
accommodation, to the post-stations, which at the best were
enclosures of mud walls on three sides, deep in manure, with
stabling on two sides, and two dark rooms at the entrance
for the servants. Occasionally an erection (<i>balakhana</i>)
above the gateway is available for the master, but how
seldom Martyn was lodged in any way better than the
animals, will be seen from his <i>Journal</i>. He had travelled
in this way, in the heats of two summers, from Bushire to
Shiraz, and from Shiraz to Tabreez, the whole extent of the
Persian plateau from south to north. He had nearly died
at Tabreez.</p>

<p>Yet now, with his Persian New Testament ready for the
press and his longing for Lydia, he again set forth, sustained
by &lsquo;the delightful thought.&rsquo; With intensest interest we
follow him in every step of his march north-west through
the Persian province of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Eastern
Asia Minor, the unconquerable spirit sustaining the feeble
body for forty-five days, as Chrysostom&rsquo;s was fed in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
southern journey to the same place of departure almost
within sight of the Euxine Sea.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1812, September 2.</i>&mdash;At sunset we left the western gate
of Tabreez behind us. The horses proved to be sorry
animals. It was midnight before we arrived at Sangla,
a village in the middle of the plain of Tabreez. There
they procured me a place in the Zabit&rsquo;s house. I slept
till after sunrise of the 3rd, and did not choose to proceed
at such an hour; so I passed most of the day in
my room. At three in the afternoon proceeded towards
Sofian. My health being again restored, through infinite
and unbounded mercy, I was able to look round
the creation with calm delight. The plain of Tabreez,
towards the west and south-west, stretches away to an
immense distance, and is bounded in these directions by
mountains so remote as to appear, from their soft blue, to
blend with the skies. The baggage having been sent on
before, I ambled on with my <i>mehmandar</i>, looking all
around me, and especially towards the distant hills, with
gratitude and joy. Oh! it is necessary to have been confined
to a bed of sickness to know the delight of moving
freely through the works of God, with the senses left at
liberty to enjoy their proper object. My attendant not
being very conversant with Persian, we rode silently along;
for my part, I could not have enjoyed any companion so
much as I did my own feelings. At sunset we reached
Sofian, a village with gardens, at the north-west end of the
plain, which is usually the first stage from Tabreez. The
Zabit was in his corn-field, under a little tent, inspecting
his labourers, who were cutting the straw fine, so as to be
fit to be eaten by cattle; this was done by drawing over
it a cylinder, armed with blades of a triangular form,
placed in different planes, so that their vertices should
coincide in the cylinder.</p>

<p>The Zabit paid me no attention, but sent a man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
show me a place to sleep in, who took me to one with
only three walls. I demanded another with four, and was
accordingly conducted to a weaver&rsquo;s, where, notwithstanding
the mosquitoes and other vermin, I passed the night
comfortably enough. On my offering money, the <i>mehmandar</i>
interfered, and said that if it were known that I
had given money he should be ruined, and added: &lsquo;They,
indeed, dare not take it;&rsquo; but this I did not find to be the
case.</p>

<p><i>September 4.</i>&mdash;At sunrise mounted my horse, and proceeded
north-west, through a pass in the mountains,
towards Murun. By the way I sat down by the brook,
and there ate my bread and raisins, and drank of the
crystal stream; but either the coldness of this unusual
breakfast, or the riding after it, did not at all agree with
me. The heat oppressed me much, and the road seemed
intolerably tedious. At last we got out from among the
mountains, and saw the village of Murun, in a fine valley
on the right. It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock when we reached
it. As the <i>mehmandar</i> could not immediately find a place
to put me in, we had a complete view of this village. They
stared at my European dress, but no disrespect was shown.
I was deposited at last with a Khan, who was seated
in a place with three walls. Not at all disposed to pass
the day in company, as well as exposed, I asked for
another room, on which I was shown to the stable, where
there was a little place partitioned off, but so as to admit
a view of the horses. The smell of the stable, though not
in general disagreeable to me, was so strong that I was
quite unwell, and strangely dispirited and melancholy.
Immediately after dinner I fell fast asleep and slept four
hours, after which I rose and ordered them to prepare for
the next journey. The horses being changed here, it was
some time before they were brought, but, by exerting
myself, we moved off by midnight. It was a most mild
and delightful night, and the pure air, after the smell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
the stable, was quite reviving. For once, also, I travelled
all the way without being sleepy; and beguiled the hours
of the way by thinking of the 14th Psalm, especially the
connection of the last three verses with the preceding.</p>

<p><i>September 5.</i>&mdash;In five hours we were just on the hills
which face the pass out of the valley of Murun (Marand),
and in four hours and a half more emerged from between
the two ridges of mountains into the valley of Gurjur.
Gurjur is eight parasangs from Murun, and our course to
it was nearly due north. This long march was far from
being a fatiguing one. The air, the road, and my spirits
were good. Here I was well accommodated, but had to
mourn over my impatient temper towards my servants; there
is nothing that disturbs my peace so much. How much
more noble and godlike to bear with calmness, and observe
with pity, rather than with anger, the failings and offences
of others! Oh, that I may, through grace, be enabled to
recollect myself in the time of temptation! Oh, that the
Spirit of God may check my folly, and at such times bring
the lowly Saviour to my view!</p>

<p><i>September 6.</i>&mdash;Soon after twelve we started with fresh
horses, and came to the Aras, or Araxes, distant two
parasangs, and about as broad as the Isis, and a current
as strong as that of the Ganges. The ferry-boat being on
the north side, I lay down to sleep till it came; but observing
my servants do the same, I was obliged to get up
and exert myself. It dawned, however, before we got over.
The boat was a huge fabric in the form of a rhombus. The
ferryman had only a stick to push with; an oar, I dare
say, he had never seen or heard of, and many of my train
had probably never floated before;&mdash;so alien is a Persian
from everything that belongs to shipping. We landed
safely on the other side in about two minutes. We were
four hours in reaching Nakshan, and for half an hour more
I was led from street to street, till at last I was lodged in
a wash-house belonging to a great man, a corner of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
was cleaned out for me. It was near noon and my baggage
was not arrived, so that I was obliged to go without my
breakfast, which was hard after a ride of four hours in the
sun. The baggage was delayed so long that I began to
fear; at last, however, it arrived. All the afternoon I
slept, and at sunset arose, and continued wakeful till midnight,
when I aroused my people, and with fresh horses
set out again. We travelled till sunrise. I scarcely
perceived that we had been moving, a Hebrew word in the
16th Psalm having led me gradually into speculations on
the eighth conjugation of the Arabic verb. I am glad my
philological curiosity is revived, as my mind will be less
liable to idleness.</p>

<p><i>September 7.</i>&mdash;Arrived at Khok, a poor village, distant
five and a half parasangs from Nakshan, nearly west. I
should have mentioned that, on descending into the plain
of Nakshan, my attention was arrested by the appearance
of a hoary mountain opposite to us at the other end, rising
so high above the rest that they sank into insignificance.
It was truly sublime, and the interest it excited was not
lessened when, on inquiring its name, I was told it was
Agri, or Ararat. Thus I saw two remarkable objects in
one day, the Araxes and Ararat. At four in the afternoon
we set out for Shurour. The evening was pleasant; the
ground over which we passed was full of rich cultivation
and verdure, watered by many a stream, and containing
forty villages, most of them with the usual appendage of
gardens. To add to the scene, the great Ararat was on
our left. On the peak of that hill the whole Church was
once contained; it was now spread far and wide, even to
the ends of the earth, but the ancient vicinity of it knows
it no more. I fancied many a spot where Noah perhaps
offered his sacrifices; and the promise of God, that seed-time
and harvest should not cease, appeared to me to be
more exactly fulfilled in the agreeable plain in which it
was spoken than elsewhere, as I had not seen such fertility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
in any part of the Shah&rsquo;s dominions. Here the blessed
saint landed in a new world; so may I, safe in Christ, out-ride
the storm of life, and land at last on one of the everlasting
hills!</p>

<p>Night coming on we lost our way, and got intercepted
by some deep ravines, into one of which the horse that
carried my trunks sunk so deep that the water got into
one of them, wetted the linen and spoiled some books.
Finding it in vain to attempt gaining our <i>munzil</i>, we went
to another village, where, after a long delay, two aged men
with silver beards opened their house to us. Though it
was near midnight I had a fire lighted to dry my books,
took some coffee and sunk into deep sleep; from which
awaking at the earliest dawn of</p>

<p><i>September 8</i>, I roused the people, and had a delightful
ride of one parasang to Shurour, distant four parasangs
from Khok. Here I was accommodated by the great man
with a stable, or winter room, for they built it in such a
strange vicinity in order to have it warm in winter. At
present, while the weather is still hot, the smell is at times
overpowering. At eleven at night we moved off, with fresh
horses, for Duwala; but though we had guides in abundance,
we were not able to extricate ourselves from the
ravines with which this village is surrounded. Procuring
another man from a village we happened to wander into,
we at last made our way, through grass and mire, to the
pass, which led us to a country as dry as the one we had
left was wet. Ararat was now quite near; at the foot of it
is Duwala, six parasangs from Nakshan, where we arrived
at seven in the morning of</p>

<p><i>September 9.</i>&mdash;As I had been thinking all night of a
Hebrew letter, I perceived little of the tediousness of the
way. I tried also some difficulties in the 16th Psalm
without being able to master them. All day on the 15th
and 16th Psalms, and gained some light into the difficulties.
The villagers not bringing the horses in time, we were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
able to go on at night, but I was not much concerned, as
I thereby gained some rest.</p>

<p><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;All day at the village writing down
notes on the 15th and 16th Psalms. Moved at midnight,
and arrived early in the morning at Erivan.</p>

<p><i>September 11.</i>&mdash;I alighted at Hosein Khan, the governor&rsquo;s
palace, as it may be called, for he seems to live in a style
equal to that of a prince. Indeed, commanding a fortress
on the frontier, within six hours of the Russians, he is entrusted
with a considerable force, and is nearly independent
of the Shah. After sleeping two hours I was summoned
to his presence. He at first took no notice of me, but
continued reading his Koran, it being the Mohurrum.
After a compliment or two he resumed his devotions.
The next ceremony was to exchange a rich shawl dress for
a still richer pelisse, on pretence of its being cold. The
next display was to call for his physician, who, after respectfully
feeling his pulse, stood on one side: this was to
show that he had a domestic physician. His servants
were most richly clad. My letter from the ambassador,
which till now had lain neglected on the ground, was
opened and read by a moonshi. He heard with great
interest what Sir Gore had written about the translation of
the Gospels. After this he was very kind and attentive,
and sent for Lieutenant M., of the Engineers, who was
stationed, with two sergeants, at the fort. He ordered for
me a <i>mehmandar</i>, a guard, and four horses with which a
Turk had just come from Kars.</p>

<p><i>September 12.</i>&mdash;The horses not being ready, I rode
alone and found my way to Etchmiatzin (or Three
Churches<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>), two and a half parasangs distant. Directing
my course to the largest church, I found it enclosed by
some other buildings and a wall. Within the entrance
I found a large court, with monks cowled and gowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
moving about. On seeing my Armenian letters they
brought me to the Patriarch&rsquo;s lodge, where I found two
bishops, one of whom was Nestus, at breakfast on pilaos,
kuwabs, wine, arrak, etc., and Serst (Serope) with them.
As he spoke English, French, and Italian, I had no difficulty
in communicating with my hosts.</p>

<p>Serope, considering the danger to which the cathedral-seat
is exposed from its situation between Russia, Persia,
and Turkey, is for building a college at Tiflis. The errors
and superstitions of his people were the subject of Serope&rsquo;s
conversation the whole morning, and seemed to be the
occasion of real grief to him. He intended, he said, after
a few more months&rsquo; trial of what he could do here, to
retire to India, and there write and print some works in
Armenian, tending to enlighten the people with regard to
religion, in order to introduce a reform. I said all I could
to encourage him in such a blessed work: promising him
every aid from the English, and proving to him, from the
example of Luther and the other European reformers,
that, however arduous the work might seem, God would
surely be with him to help him. I mentioned the awful
neglect of the Armenian clergy in never preaching; as
thereby the glad tidings of a Saviour were never proclaimed.
He made no reply to this, but that &lsquo;it was to be lamented,
as the people were never called away from vice.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>September 13.</i>&mdash;I asked Serope about the 16th Psalm
in the Armenian version; he translated it into correct
Latin. In the afternoon I waited on the Patriarch; it was
a visit of great ceremony. He was reclining on a sort of
throne, placed in the middle of the room. All stood except
the two senior bishops; a chair was set for me on the
other side, close to the Patriarch; at my right hand stood
Serope, to interpret. The Patriarch had a dignified
rather than a venerable appearance. His conversation
consisted in protestations of sincere attachment, in expressions
of his hopes of deliverance from the Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
yoke, and inquiries about my translations of the Scriptures;
and he begged me to consider myself as at home
in the monastery. Indeed, their attention and kindness
are unbounded: Nestus and Serope anticipate my every
wish. I told the Patriarch that I was so happy in being
here that, did duty permit, I could almost be willing
to become a monk with them. He smiled, and fearing,
perhaps, that I was in earnest, said that they had quite
enough. Their number is a hundred, I think. The church
was immensely rich till about ten years ago, when, by
quarrels between two contending patriarchs, one of whom
is still in the monastery in disgrace, most of their money
was expended in referring their disputes to the Mohammedans
as arbitrators. There is no difficulty, however, in
replenishing their coffers: their merchants in India are
entirely at their command.</p>

<p><i>September 15.</i>&mdash;Spent the day in preparing, with Serope,
for the mode of travelling in Turkey. All my heavy and
expensive preparations at Tabreez prove to be incumbrances
which must be left behind: my trunks were exchanged
for bags; and my portable table and chair, several books,
large supplies of sugar, etc., were condemned to be left
behind. My humble equipments were considered as too
mean for an English gentleman; so Serope gave me an
English bridle and saddle. The roads in Turkey being
much more infested with robbers than those of Persia, a
sword was brought for me.</p>

<p><i>September 16.</i>&mdash;Upon the whole I hardly know what
hopes to entertain from the projects of Serope. He is
bold, authoritative, and very able; still only thirty-one
years of age; but then he is not spiritual: perhaps this was
the state of Luther himself at first. It is an interesting
time in the world; all things proclaim the approach of the
kingdom of God, and Armenia is not forgotten. There is
a monastery of Armenian Catholics at Venice, which they
employ merely in printing the Psalter, book of prayers, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
Serope intends addressing his first work to them, as they
are the most able divines of the Armenians, to argue them
back from the Roman Catholic communion, in which case
he thinks they would co-operate with him cordially; being
as much concerned as himself at the gross ignorance of
their countrymen. The Archbishop of Astrakhan has a
press, also an agent at Madras and one at Constantinople,
printing the Scriptures and books of prayers: there is none
at Etchmiatzin. At Constantinople are three or four
fellow-collegians of Serope, educated as well as he by the
Propaganda, who used to entertain the same sentiments as
he, and would, he thinks, declare them if he would begin.</p>

<p><i>September 17.</i>&mdash;At six in the morning, accompanied by
Serope, one bishop, the secretary, and several servants of
the monastery, I left Etchmiatzin. My party now consisted
of two men from the governor of Erivan, a <i>mehmandar</i>,
and a guard; my servant Sergius, for whom the monks
interceded, as he had some business at Constantinople;
one trusty servant from the monastery, Melcom, who carried
my money; and two baggage-horses with their owners.
The monks soon returned, and we pursued our way over
the plain of Ararat. At twelve o&rsquo;clock reached Quila Gazki,
about six parasangs from Etchmiatzin. The <i>mehmandar</i>
rode on, and got a good place for me.</p>

<p><i>September 18.</i>&mdash;Rose with the dawn, in hopes of going
this stage before breakfast, but the horses were not ready.
I set off at eight, fearing no sun, though I found it at times
very oppressive when there was no wind. At the end of
three hours we left the plain of Ararat, the last of the
plains of modern Persia in this quarter. Meeting here
with the Araxes again, I undressed and plunged into the
stream.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> While hastening forward with the trusty Melcom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
to rejoin my party, we were overtaken by a spearman with
a lance of formidable length. I did not think it likely that
one man would venture to attack two, both armed; but
the spot was a noted one for robbers, and very well calculated,
by its solitariness, for deeds of privacy; however, he
was friendly enough. He had, however, nearly done me a
mischief. On the bank of the river we sprang a covey of
partridges; instantly he laid his lance under him across
the horse&rsquo;s back, and fired a horse-pistol at them. His
horse, starting at the report, came upon mine, with the
point of the spear directly towards me, so that I thought a
wound for myself or horse was inevitable; but the spear
passed under my horse. We were to have gone to Haji-Buhirem,
but finding the head-man of it at a village a few
furlongs nearer, we stopped there. We found him in a
shed outside the walls, reading his Koran, with his sword,
gun, and pistol by his side. He was a good-natured farmer-looking
man, and spoke in Persian. He chanted the Arabic
with great readiness, and asked me whether I knew what
that book was: &lsquo;Nothing less than the great Koran!&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>September 19.</i>&mdash;Left the village at seven in the morning,
and as the stage was reputed to be very dangerous, owing
to the vicinity of the famous Kara Beg, my <i>mehmandar</i>
took three armed men from the village in addition to the
one we brought from Erivan. We continued going along
through the pass two or three parasangs, and crossed the
Araxes three times. We then ascended the mountains on
the north by a road, if not so steep, yet as long and difficult
as any of the <i>kotuls</i> of Bushire. On the top we found
a table-land, along which we moved many a tedious mile,
expecting every minute that we should have a view of a
fine champaign country below; but dale followed dale,
apparently in endless succession, and though at such a
height there was very little air to relieve the heat, and
nothing to be seen but barren rocks. One part, however,
must be excepted, where the prospect opened to the north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
and we had a view of the Russian territory, so that we
saw at once, Persia, Russia, and Turkey. At length we
came to an Armenian village, situated in a hollow of these
mountains, on a declivity. The village presented a singular
appearance, being filled with conical piles of peat, for they
have no fire-wood. Around there was a great deal of
cultivation, chiefly corn. Most of the low land from
Tabreez to this place is planted with cotton, <i>Palma Christi</i>,
and rice. This is the first village in Turkey; not a Persian
cap was to be seen, the respectable people wore a red
Turkish cap. The great man of the village paid me a visit;
he was a young Mussulman, and took care of all my
Mussulman attendants; but he left me and my Armenians,
where he found us, at the house of an Armenian, without
offering his services. I was rather uncomfortably lodged,
my room being a thoroughfare for horses, cows, buffaloes,
and sheep. Almost all the village came to look at me.
The name of this village is Fiwik, it is distant six parasangs
from the last; but we were eight hours accomplishing it,
and a kafila would have been twelve. We arrived at three
o&rsquo;clock; both horses and men much fatigued.</p>

<p><i>September 20.</i>&mdash;From daybreak to sunrise I walked,
then breakfasted and set out. Our course lay north, over
a mountain, and here danger was apprehended. It was,
indeed, dismally solitary all around. The appearance of
an old castle on the top of a crag was the first occasion on
which our guard got their pieces ready, and one rode
forward to reconnoitre: but all there was as silent as the
grave. At last, after travelling five hours, we saw some
men: our guard again took their places in front. Our fears
were soon removed by seeing carts and oxen. Not so the
opposite party: for my baggage was so small as not to be
easily perceived. They halted therefore at the bottom,
towards which we were both descending, and those of them
who had guns advanced in front and hailed us. We
answered peaceably; but they, still distrusting us as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
advanced nearer, cocked their pieces. Soon, however, we
came to a parley. They were Armenians, bringing wood
from Kars to their village in the mountain: they were
hardy, fine young men, and some old men who were with
them were particularly venerable. The dangerous spots
being passed through, my party began to sport with their
horses: galloping across the path, brandishing their spears
or sticks, they darted them just at that moment of wheeling
round their horses, as if that motion gave them an advantage.
It struck me that this, probably, was the mode of
fighting of the ancient Parthians which made them so
terrible in flight. Presently after these gambols the appearance
of some poor countrymen with their carts put
into their heads another kind of sport; for knowing, from
the ill-fame of the spot, that we should be easily taken for
robbers, four of them galloped forward, and by the time
we reached them one of the carters was opening a bag to
give them something. I was, of course, very much displeased,
and made signs to him not to do it. I then told
them all, as we quickly pursued our course, that such kind
of sport was not allowed in England; they said it was the
Persian custom. We arrived at length at Ghanikew, having
ridden six hours and a half without intermission. The
<i>mehmandar</i> was for changing his route continually, either
from real or pretended fear. One of the Kara Beg&rsquo;s men
saw me at the village last night, and as he would probably
get intelligence of my pretended route, it was desirable to
elude him. But after all we went the shortest way, through
the midst of danger, if there was any, and a gracious
Providence kept all mischief at a distance. Ghanikew is
only two parasangs from Kars, but I stopped there, as I
saw it was more agreeable to the people; besides which I
wished to have a ride before breakfast. I was lodged in a
stable-room; but very much at my ease, as none of the
people of the village could come at me without passing
through the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p><i>September 21.</i>&mdash;Rode into Kars. Its appearance is
quite European, not only at a distance but within. The
houses all of stone; streets with carts passing; some of
the houses open to the street; the fort on an uncommonly
high rock; such a burying-ground I never saw, there must
be thousands of gravestones. The <i>mehmandar</i> carried me
directly to the governor, who, having just finished his
breakfast, was of course asleep, and could not be disturbed;
but his head-man carried me to an Armenian&rsquo;s house, with
orders to live at free quarter there. The room at the
Armenian&rsquo;s was an excellent one, upstairs, facing the street,
fort, and river, with a bow containing five windows under
which were cushions. As soon as the Pacha was visible,
the chief Armenian of Kars, to whom I had a letter from
Bishop Nestus, his relation, waited upon him on my business.
On looking over my letters of recommendation from
Sir Gore Ouseley, I found there was none for Abdallah, the
Pacha of Kars; however, the letter to the Governor of
Erivan secured all I wanted. He sent to say I was
welcome; that if I liked to stay a few days he should be
happy, but that if I was determined to go on to-morrow,
the necessary horses and ten men for a guard were all
ready. As no wish was expressed of seeing me, I was of
course silent upon that subject.</p>

<p><i>September 22.</i>&mdash;Promises were made that everything
should be ready at sunrise, but it was half-past nine before
we started, and no guard present but the Tartar. He
presently began to show his nature by flogging the baggage-horse
with his long whip, as one who was not disposed
to allow loitering; but one of the poor beasts presently fell
with his load at full length over a piece of timber lying
in the road. While this was setting to rights, the people
gathered about me, and seemed more engaged with my
Russian boots than with any other part of my dress. We
moved south-west, and after five hours and a half reached
Joula. The Tartar rode forward and got the coffee-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
at the post-house ready. The coffee-room has one side
railed and covered with cushions, and on the opposite side
cushions on the ground; the rest of the room was left with
bare stones and timbers. As the wind blew very cold
yesterday, and I had caught cold, the Tartar ordered a
great fire to be made. In this room I should have been
very much to my satisfaction, had not the Tartar taken
part of the same bench, and many other people made use
of it as a public room. They were continually consulting
my watch to know how near the hour of eating approached.
It was evident that the Tartar was the great man here; he
took the best place for himself; a dinner of four or five
dishes was laid before him. When I asked for eggs they
brought me rotten ones; for butter they brought me ghee.
The idle people of the village came all night and smoked
till morning. It was very cold, there being a hoar frost.</p>

<p><i>September 23.</i>&mdash;Our way to-day lay through a forest
of firs, and the variety of prospect it afforded, of hill and
dale, wood and lawn, was beautiful and romantic. No
mark of human workmanship was anywhere visible for
miles, except where some trees had fallen by the stroke of
the woodman. We saw at last a few huts in the thickest
clumps, which was all we saw of the Koords, for fear
of whom I was attended by ten armed horsemen. We
frightened a company of villagers again to-day. They
were bringing wood and grass from the forest, and on
seeing us drew up. One of our party advanced and fired;
such a rash piece of sport I thought must have been
followed by serious mischief, but all passed off very well.
With the forest I was delighted; the clear streams in the
valleys, the lofty trees crowning the summit of the hills,
the smooth paths winding away and losing themselves in
the dark woods, and, above all, the solitude that reigned
throughout, composed a scene which tended to harmonise
and solemnise the mind. What displays of taste and
magnificence are found occasionally on this ruined earth!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
Nothing was wanting to-day but the absence of the Turks,
to avoid the sight and sound of whom I rode on. After a
ride of nine hours and a half, we reached Mijingui, in the
territory of Erzroom, and having resolved not to be
annoyed in the same way as last night, I left the Tartar in
the undisturbed possession of the post-house, and took up
my quarters at an Armenian&rsquo;s, where, in the stable-room,
I expected to be left alone; but a Georgian young man,
on his way from Etchmiatzin, going on pilgrimage to
Moosk, where John the Baptist is supposed to be buried,
presumed on his assiduous attentions to me, and contrived
to get a place for himself in the same room.</p>

<p><i>September 24.</i>&mdash;A long and sultry march over many a
hill and vale. In the way, two hours from the last stage,
is a hot spring; the water fills a pool, having four porches.
The porches instantly reminded me of Bethesda&rsquo;s pool:
they were semicircular arches about six feet deep, intended
seemingly for shelter from the sun. In them all the party
undressed and bathed. The Tartar, to enjoy himself more
perfectly, had his <i>kalean</i> to smoke while up to his chin in
water. We saw nothing else on the road to-day but a large
and opulent family of Armenians&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;in carts and carriages returning from a pilgrimage
to Moosk. After eleven hours and a half, including the
hour spent at the warm spring, we were overtaken by the
dusk; so the Tartar brought us to Oghoomra, where I was
placed in an Armenian&rsquo;s stable-room.</p>

<p><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;Went round to Husar-Quile, where we
changed horses. I was surprised to find so strong a fort
and so large a town. From thence we were five hours and
a half reaching the entrance of Erzroom. All was busy and
moving in the streets and shops&mdash;crowds passing along.
Those who caught a sight of us were at a loss to define me.
My Persian attendants and the lower part of the dress
made me appear Persian; but the rest of my dress was
new, for those only who had travelled knew it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
European. They were rather disposed, I thought, to be
uncivil, but the two persons who preceded us kept all in
order. I felt myself in a Turkish town; the red cap, and
stateliness, and rich dress, and variety of turbans was
realised as I had seen it in pictures. There are here four
thousand Armenian families and but one church; there
are scarcely any Catholics, and they have no church.</p>

<p><i>September 29.</i>&mdash;Left Erzroom with a Tartar and his
son at two in the afternoon. We moved to a village, where
I was attacked with fever and ague; the Tartar&rsquo;s son was
also taken ill and obliged to return.</p>

<p><i>September 30.</i>&mdash;Travelled first to Ashgula, where we
changed horses, and from thence to Purnugaban, where we
halted for the night. I took nothing all day but tea, and
was rather better, but head-ache and loss of appetite
depressed my spirits; yet my soul rests in Him who is &lsquo;an
anchor to the soul, sure and steadfast,&rsquo; which, though not
seen, keeps me fast.</p>

<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;Marched over a mountainous tract; we
were out from seven in the morning till eight at night.
After sitting a little by the fire, I was near fainting from
sickness. My depression of spirits led me to the throne of
grace as a sinful abject worm. When I thought of myself
and my transgressions, I could find no text so cheering as
&lsquo;My ways are not as your ways.&rsquo; From the men who
accompanied Sir Gore Ouseley to Constantinople I learned
that the plague was raging at that place, and thousands
dying every day. One of the Persians had died of it.
They added that the inhabitants of Tokat were flying from
their town from the same cause. Thus I am passing
inevitably into imminent danger. O Lord, Thy will be
done! Living or dying, remember me!</p>

<p><i>October 2.</i>&mdash;Some hours before day I sent to tell the
Tartar I was ready, but Hassan Aga was for once riveted
to his bed. However, at eight, having got strong horses,
he set off at a great rate; and over the level ground he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
made us gallop as fast as the horses would go to Chifflik,
where we arrived at sunset. I was lodged, at my request,
in the stables of the post-house, not liking the scrutinising
impudence of the fellows who frequent the coffee-room.
As soon as it began to grow a little cold the ague came on,
and then the fever; after which I had a sleep, which let
me know too plainly the disorder of my frame. In the
night Hassan sent to summon me away, but I was quite
unable to move. Finding me still in bed at the dawn, he
began to storm furiously at my detaining him so long, but
I quietly let him spend his ire, ate my breakfast composedly,
and set out at eight. He seemed determined to make up
for the delay, for we flew over hill and dale to Sherean,
where he changed horses. From thence we travelled all
the rest of the day and all night; it rained most of the
time. Soon after sunset the ague came on again, which,
in my wet state, was very trying; I hardly knew how to
keep my life in me. About that time there was a village
at hand, but Hassan had no mercy. At one in the morning
we found two men under a wain, with a good fire; they
could not keep the rain out, but their fire was acceptable.
I dried my lower extremities, allayed the fever by drinking
a good deal of water, and went on. We had little rain, but
the night was pitchy dark so that I could not see the road
under my horse&rsquo;s feet. However, God being mercifully
pleased to alleviate my bodily suffering, I went on contentedly
to the <i>munzil</i>, where we arrived at break of day.
After sleeping three or four hours, I was visited by an Armenian
merchant for whom I had a letter. Hassan was in
great fear of being arrested here; the Governor of the city
had vowed to make an example of him for riding to death
a horse belonging to a man of this place. He begged that
I would shelter him in case of danger; his being claimed
by an Englishman, he said, would be a sufficient security.
I found, however, that I had no occasion to interfere. He
hurried me away from this place without delay, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
galloped furiously towards a village, which, he said, was
four hours distant, which was all I could undertake in my
present weak state; but village after village did he pass till,
night coming on, and no signs of another, I suspected that
he was carrying me on to the <i>munzil</i>; so I got off my
horse and sat upon the ground, and told him &lsquo;I neither
could nor would go any farther.&rsquo; He stormed, but I was
immovable, till, a light appearing at a distance, I mounted
my horse and made towards it, leaving him to follow or
not, as he pleased. He brought in the party, but would
not exert himself to get a place for me. They brought
me to an open verandah, but Sergius told them I wanted
a place in which to be alone. This seemed very offensive
to them. &lsquo;And why must he be alone?&rsquo; they asked,
ascribing this desire of mine to pride, I suppose. Tempted
at last by money, they brought me to a stable-room, and
Hassan and a number of others planted themselves there
with me. My fever here increased to a violent degree; the
heat in my eyes and forehead was so great that the fire
almost made me frantic. I entreated that it might be put
out, or that I might be carried out of doors. Neither was
attended to; my servant, who, from my sitting in that
strange way on the ground, believed me delirious, was deaf
to all I said. At last I pushed my head among the luggage,
and lodged it on the damp ground, and slept.</p></div>

<p>From Sherean, or Sheheran, out of which, after a night
of burning fever in the stable of the Chifflik post-station,
Hassan furiously compelled the dying man to ride, is a
mountain track of a hundred and seventy miles to Tokat.
&lsquo;How wearisome and painful must have been his journey
over the mountains and valleys!&rsquo; wrote the American
missionaries, Eli Smith and H.O. Dwight, eighteen years
after, when, in the vigour of health and at a better season,
they made the same journey, called by his example and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
memory, to found the Mission to Eastern Anatolia. Think
of him, wasting away from consumption, racked with ague,
burning with fever, as, pressed by the merciless Turk, he
&lsquo;flew over hill and dale&rsquo; all the third day of October, from
eight in the morning, then changed horses at Sheheran,
then &lsquo;travelled all the rest of the day and all night&rsquo; of the
3rd-4th, while the rain fell amid darkness that could
be felt; then, after three or four hours&rsquo; sleep, on break
of day again hurried on, lest his guide should be arrested
for a former offence of &lsquo;riding to death a horse belonging
to a man of this place,&rsquo; all the fourth day, till almost
expiring he sat on the ground and found refuge in a
stable, refusing to go farther. &lsquo;At last I pushed my head
among the luggage, and lodged it on the damp ground, and
slept.&rsquo; Since Chrysostom&rsquo;s ride in the same region, the
Church of Christ has seen no torture of a saint like
that.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>October 5.</i>&mdash;Preserving mercy made me see the light of
another morning. The sleep had refreshed me, but I was
feeble and shaken; yet the merciless Hassan hurried me
off. The <i>munzil</i>, however, not being distant, I reached it
without much difficulty. I expected to have found it
another strong fort at the end of the pass, but it is a poor
little village within the jaws of the mountain. I was
pretty well lodged, and felt tolerably well till a little after
sunset, when the ague came on with a violence I had never
before experienced; I felt as if in a palsy, my teeth
chattering and my whole frame violently shaken. Aga
Hosein and another Persian, on their way here from
Constantinople, going to Abbas Mirza whom I had just
before been visiting, came hastily to render me assistance
if they could. These Persians appear quite brotherly
after the Turks. While they pitied me, Hassan sat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
perfect indifference, ruminating on the further delay this
was likely to occasion. The cold fit, after continuing two
or three hours, was followed by a fever, which lasted the
whole night and prevented sleep.</p>

<p><i>October 6.</i>&mdash;No horses being to be had, I had an
unexpected repose. I sat in the orchard and thought
with sweet comfort and peace of my God, in solitude
my Company, my Friend, and Comforter. Oh! when shall
time give place to eternity! When shall appear that new
heaven and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness!
There, there shall in no wise enter in anything that
defileth: none of that wickedness which has made men
worse than wild beasts, none of those corruptions which
add still more to the miseries of mortality, shall be seen or
heard of any more.</p></div>

<p>Sitting in the orchard, thinking with sweet comfort and
peace of his God, and longing for that new heaven and
new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness&mdash;such is the
last sight we have of Henry Martyn, on October 6, 1812.
Two brotherly Persians, on their way from Constantinople,
had sought to minister to him the day before. The Turkish
Hassan, himself afraid of justice, &lsquo;sat in perfect indifference,
ruminating on the further delay&rsquo; caused by his illness.
What happened when the dying apostle could write no
more&mdash;in the ten days till God took him on October 16&mdash;who
shall now tell? Did the Turk hurry him, as he was
expiring, into Tokat, from &lsquo;that poor little village within
the jaws of the mountain,&rsquo; in which he was &lsquo;pretty well
lodged,&rsquo; or did his indomitable spirit give the poor body
strength to ride into the town; and did the plague, then
raging, complete what hereditary disease and fever had
done? He had at least his Armenian servants, the &lsquo;trusty&rsquo;
Melcom and Sergius, with him to minister to his wants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
He had written to Lydia of his journey to her by
Constantinople, Syria, and Malta, saying: &lsquo;Do I dream,
that I venture to think and write of such an event as
that!... Soon we shall have occasion for pen and ink
no more, but I trust I shall shortly see thee face to face.&rsquo;
He dreamed indeed; for He who is the only Love which
is no dream, but the one transforming, abiding, absorbing
reality, called him, while yet a youth of thirty-one, home
to Himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="subheading">THE TWO RESTING-PLACES&mdash;TOKAT AND BREAGE</p>


<p>The Armenians were a comparatively strong community
in Tokat, where they formed a third of the population, for
whom there were seven churches and thirty priests. Henry
Martyn was known as a friend of this, the oldest church in
Asia. He had sought out their priests and families all
over Persia and the Araxes valley, and ministered to
many of this oppressed people. The two servants with
whom he had journeyed as far as Tokat were Armenians,
and he especially trusted Sergius, whom he had engaged
at Etchmiatzin, as one about to visit Constantinople, and
not unfamiliar with the route. The body of the wearied
traveller to the city of the Great King was laid to rest in
the extensive cemetery of the church of Karasoon Manoog.
Later research revealed the fact that the body was buried
in simple and reverent Oriental fashion&mdash;not in a coffin,
but in such a white winding-sheet as that which for forty
hours enwrapped the Crucified. The story afterwards went
that the chaplain-missionary of the East India Company
was carried to the tomb with all the honours of an
Armenian archbishop. That is most probable, for the
Armenian clergy of Calcutta, Bushire, and Shiraz always
gave him priestly honours during life. The other tradition&mdash;that
his burial was hardly decent&mdash;has arisen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
the circumstances that attended the search for his grave
and the removal of his dust to the American Mission
Cemetery forty years afterwards.</p>

<p>Far away, in the most distant corner of Asiatic
Turkey, or Turkish Arabia, at Baghdad, there was one<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Anglo-Indian scholar and Christian, who hastened to
discharge the pious duty of carving on a limestone slab
above the precious remains a Latin inscription. That was
the East India Company&rsquo;s civil servant, James Claudius
Rich. Born near Dijon in 1787&mdash;six years after Martyn&mdash;and
taken in his infancy to Bristol, he there manifested
such extraordinary linguistic powers, even in boyhood, that
Joshua Marshman, before he went out to Serampore,
helped him with books and introduced him to Dr. Ryland.
Robert Hall formed such an opinion of his powers, which
the earliest Orientalist, Sir Charles Wilkins, tested, that
he received an appointment to the Bombay Civil Service,
and was introduced to Sir James Mackintosh. He went
to India overland through Turkish Asia, disguised as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
Georgian Turk, so that the Mecca pilgrims at Damascus
did not discover him. He married Sir James&rsquo;s eldest
daughter,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and had set out as the Company&rsquo;s Resident at
Baghdad and Busrah, not long before Martyn arrived at
Bombay. The two men never met, for Martyn&rsquo;s attempt
to enter Arabia from Persia through Baghdad was stopped.
But the young Orientalist watched Martyn&rsquo;s career with
admiration, and seems to have followed his footsteps. In
1821 he himself was cut off by cholera, while ministering
to the plague-stricken in Shiraz, leaving a name imperishably
associated with that of Sir James Mackintosh,
and dear to all Oriental scholars and travellers, but henceforth
to be remembered above all as that of the man who
was the first to perpetuate the memory of Henry Martyn.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The sacred spot was immediately at the foot of slaty
rocks down which the winter snows and summer rains
washed enough of stony soil every year to cover up the
horizontal slab. The first to visit it with reverent steps
after the pious commission of Claudius James Rich had
been executed, was Sir Robert Ker Porter. Although
only a few years had elapsed, he seems to have failed to
see the inscription which fitly commemorated the &lsquo;Sacerdos
ac Missionarius Anglorum,&rsquo; so that he thus beautifully
wrote: &lsquo;His remains sleep in a grave as humble as his own
meekness; but while that high pyramidal hill, marked
with its mouldering ruins of heathen ages, points to the
sky, every European traveller must see in it their honoured
countryman&rsquo;s monument.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1830, when the American Board&rsquo;s missionaries, Eli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
Smith and H.G.O. Dwight, visited Tokat, they had little
difficulty in finding the spot, from which they wrote: &lsquo;An
appropriate Latin inscription is all that distinguishes his
tomb from the tombs of the Armenians who sleep by his
side.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> They urged their Board to make Tokat its centre of
operations for the people of Second Armenia, as Cæsarea
for those of the First and Third Armenia, and Tarsus for
those of Cilicia. As they, reversing his northward
journey, reached Tabreez sick, they were cared for, first by
Dr., afterwards Sir John McNeill, and then by Dr. Cormick,
the same physician who healed Martyn of a similar disease
when he was at this city. &lsquo;He seemed to have retained the
highest opinion of him as a Christian, a companion, and a
scholar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1841 Mr. George Fowler published his <i>Three Years
in Persia</i>, in which a chapter is filled with reminiscences of
Henry Martyn.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of this distinguished missionary and champion of the
Cross, who fearlessly unfolded his banner and proclaimed
Christ amongst the bigoted Mahometans, I have heard
much in these countries, having made acquaintance with
some persons who knew him, and saw (if I may so say)
the last of him. At the General&rsquo;s table at Erzroom
(Paskevitch), I had the honour to meet graffs and princes,
consisting of Russians, Georgians, Circassians, Germans,
Spaniards, and Persians, all glittering in their stars and
orders, such a <i>mélange</i> as is scarcely to be found again under
one banner; looking more like a monarch&rsquo;s levy than anything
else. My neighbour was an Armenian bishop, who,
with his long flowing hair and beard, and austere habits,
the cross being suspended to his girdle, presented a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
contrast to the military chiefs. There were many other
priests at the table, of whom he was the principal. He
addressed me in my native tongue very tolerably, asking
if I had known anything of the missionary, Martyn. The
name was magic to my ear, and immediately our colloquy
became to me of great interest.</p>

<p>The bishop was the Serrafino of whom Martyn speaks
in his <i>Journal</i>, I happening at the time to have it with
me. He was very superior to the general caste of the
Armenian clergy, having been educated at Rome, and had
attained many European languages. He made Martyn&rsquo;s
acquaintance at Etchmiatzin, the Armenian monastery at
Erivan, where he had gone to pay a visit to the Patriarch
or chief of that people, and remained three days to recruit
his exhausted strength. He described him to me as being
of a very delicate frame, thin, and not quite of the middle
stature, a beardless youth, with a countenance beaming
with so much benignity as to bespeak an errand of Divine
love. Of the affairs of the world he seemed to be so
ignorant, that Serrafino was obliged to manage for him
respecting his travelling arrangements, money matters, etc.
Of the latter he had a good deal with him when he left the
monastery, and seemed to be careless, and even profuse, in
his expenditure. He was strongly recommended to postpone
his journey, but from his extreme impatience to
return to England these remonstrances were unavailing.
A Tartar was employed to conduct him to Tokat. Serrafino
accompanied him for an hour or two on the way&mdash;with
considerable apprehensions, as he told me, of his ever
arriving in his native country.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> He was greatly surprised,
he said, not only to find in him all the ornaments of a
refined education, but that he was so eminent a Christian;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
&lsquo;since (said he) all the English I have hitherto met with,
not only make no profession of religion, but live seemingly
in contempt of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I endeavoured to convince him that his impression of
the English character was in this respect erroneous; that
although a Martyn on the Asiatic soil might be deemed a
phœnix, yet many such existed in that country which gave
him birth; and I instanced to him the Christian philanthropy
of my countrymen, which induced them to search
the earth&rsquo;s boundaries to extend their faith. I told him of
our immense voluntary taxation to aid the missionaries in
that object, and of the numerous Christian associations,&mdash;for
which the world was scarcely large enough to expend
themselves upon.</p>

<p>He listened with great attention, and then threw in the
compliment, &lsquo;You English are very difficult to become
acquainted with, but when once we know you we can
depend on you.&rsquo; He complained of some part of Martyn&rsquo;s
<i>Journal</i> referring to himself, respecting his then idea of
retiring to India, to write and print some works in the
Armenian language, tending to enlighten that people with
regard to religion. He said that what followed of the
errors and superstitions of the Armenian Church should
not have been inserted in the book, nor did he think it
would be found in Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i>. His complaint rested
much on the compilers of the work in this respect; he said,
&lsquo;these opinions were not exactly so expressed, and certainly
they were not intended to come before the public, whereby
they might ultimately be turned against me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At Erzroom, on my way to Persia, I had met with an
Italian doctor, then in the Pasha&rsquo;s employ, from whom I
heard many interesting particulars respecting Martyn. He
was at Tokat at the time of our countryman&rsquo;s arrival and
death, which occurred on October 16, 1812; but whether
occasioned by the plague, or from excessive fatigue by
the brutal treatment of the Tartar, he could not determine.
His remains were decently interred in the Armenian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
burying-ground, and for a time the circumstance was
forgotten. Some years afterwards, a gentleman, at the
request of the British ambassador in Constantinople, had a
commemorative stone erected to his memory, and application
was made to the Armenian bishop to seek the grave
for that purpose. He seemed to have forgotten altogether
such an occurrence, but referring to some memoranda which
he had made of so remarkable a case as that of interring a
Feringhi stranger, he was enabled to trace the humble
tablet with which he had distinguished it. It is now
ornamented with a white slab, stating merely the name,
age, and time of death of the deceased.</p>

<p>I had many reminiscences of Martyn, at Marand particularly.
I quitted this place at midnight, just at the time
and under the circumstances which he describes. &lsquo;It was
a most mild and delightful night, and the pure air, after
the smell of the stable, was reviving.&rsquo; I was equally solitary
with himself. I had attached great interest to my
resting-place, believing it to have been the same on which
Martyn had reposed, from his own description, as it was
the usual reception for travellers, the <i>munzil</i>, or post-house.
Here I found myself almost alone, as with Aliverdy, my
guide, not three words of understanding existed between
us. Martyn says, &lsquo;They stared at my European dress,
but no disrespect was shown.&rsquo; Exactly so with me: the
villagers stood around questioning my attendant, who was
showing me off, I know not why.</p>

<p>Martyn&rsquo;s description of the stable was precisely what I
found it; thus&mdash;&lsquo;I was shown into the stable, where there
was a little place partitioned off, but so as to admit a view
of the horses.&rsquo; He was &lsquo;dispirited and melancholy.&rsquo; I
was not a little touched with this in my solitariness, and
sensibly felt with the poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Thou dost not know how sad it is to stray<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Amid a foreign land, thyself unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And, when o&rsquo;erwearied with the toilsome day,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">To rest at eve and feel thyself alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p><p>At Khoi, on my return, I witnessed the Persian
ceremony related by Martyn in his <i>Journal</i> of the death
of Imam Hussein&mdash;the anniversary of which is so religiously
observed in that country. At Tabreez I heard much of
him who was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">Faithful found<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Among the faithless&mdash;faithful only he,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Unshaken, unseduced, unterrifed,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">His loyalty he kept&mdash;his zeal&mdash;his love.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I scarcely remember so bright an ornament to the
Christian profession, on heathen land, as this hero of the
Cross, who was &lsquo;patient in tribulation, rejoicing in hope;&rsquo;
and I heard him thus spoken of by those who could
estimate the <i>man</i>, and perhaps not appreciate the <i>missionary</i>&mdash;&lsquo;If
ever there was a saint on earth, it was Martyn; and
if there be now an angel in heaven, it is Martyn.&rsquo; Amidst
the contumely of the bigoted Mussulmans, he had much
to bear, as to the natural man, amongst whom he was
called an &lsquo;Isauvi&rsquo; (the term given to Christians).</p>

<p>I know of no people where, to all human calculation,
so little prospect opens of planting the Cross. The moollas
are by no means averse to religious discussion, and still
remember the &lsquo;enlightened infidel,&rsquo; as Martyn was called;
but so bigoted are these benighted Moslems, and show so
much zeal, as I noticed at their Ramazan, that they scorn
us, and, I may say, they shame us. It is interesting, when
looking at those dark regions, to inquire&mdash;when shall the
Cross triumph over the Crescent? when shall the riches
and power of the Gospel spread over their soil, root up
the weeds of error, and produce the fruits of righteousness?</p>

<p>Since the days of Martyn but little effort has been
made by the Missionary Society to turn the tide of
Christian philanthropy towards this country; but I would
say, spite of the discouragements, Send your missionaries
to this stronghold of Mahomet; here plant your standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
of redeeming love to the wretched devotee of the impostor;
to the sometime worshipper of the sun hang out the banner
of the Sun of Righteousness; kindle in his bosom the flame
of Divine truth, that the Holy Spirit, of which his former
god was the emblem, may enlighten and guide him into
the fold of Christ.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to find from a paper in the <i>Asiatic
Register</i>, the writer of which spent a few weeks at Shiraz,
that the love and work of this distinguished missionary,
although he saw no fruits from them, have in one instance
proved that his labour has not been in vain in the Lord.
He relates that in that city he met with an interesting
character, Mahomed Rahim, who had been educated for a
moolla; a man of considerable learning, and much attached
to the English. He found him reading a volume of
<i>Cowper&rsquo;s Poems</i>, and was astonished at the precision with
which he expressed himself in English; this led to the
subject of religion, when he acknowledged himself to be a
Christian, and related the following circumstance.</p>

<p>In the year of the Hegira 1223 there came to this city
an Englishman, who taught the religion of Christ with a
boldness hitherto unparalleled in Persia, in the midst of much
scorn and ill-treatment from the moollas as well as the
rabble. He was a beardless youth, and evidently enfeebled
by disease; he dwelt among us for more than a year. I
was then a decided enemy to infidels, as the Christians
are termed by the followers of Mahomet, and I visited this
teacher of the despised sect, for the purpose of treating
him with scorn, and exposing his doctrines to contempt.
Although I persevered in this conduct for some time, I
found that every interview not only increased my respect
for the individual, but diminished my confidence in the
faith in which I was educated. His extreme forbearance
towards the violence of his opponents, the calm and yet
convincing manner in which he exposed the fallacies and
sophistries by which he was assailed (for he spoke Persian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
excellently), gradually inclined me to listen to his arguments,
to inquire dispassionately into the subject of them,
and finally to read a tract which he had written in reply
to <i>A Defence of Islam</i>, by our chief moollas. The result of
my examination was a conviction that the young disputant
was right. Shame, or rather fear, withheld me from this
opinion; I even avoided the society of the Christian
teacher, though he remained in the city so long. Just
before he quitted Shiraz I could not refrain from paying
him a farewell visit. Our conversation, the memory of
which will never fade from the tablet of my mind, sealed
my conversion. He gave me a book; it has been my
constant companion; the study of it has formed my most
delightful occupation; its contents have often consoled
me. Upon this he put into my hand a copy of the New
Testament in Persian; on one of the blank leaves was
written, &lsquo;There is joy in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth. <span class="smcap">Henry Martyn.</span>&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>The memory of Henry Martyn was borne by Mussulmans
to Northern Africa, and south to India again. The
late Rev. Mr. Oakley, of St. Paul&rsquo;s, Onslow Square, London,
when travelling south of Algiers, met Mohammedans who
asked him if he were of the same tribe as Henry Martyn,
the man of God whose controversy at Shiraz and books
they knew. A Persian of gentle manners, who had a surprising
knowledge of the <i>Mesnevi</i>, that inexhaustible fountain
of Soofi philosophy, received a copy of Martyn&rsquo;s Persian
New Testament. After fourteen years&rsquo; study of it, in
silence, he applied to the nearest Christian, an Armenian
bishop, for baptism unto Christ. Fearing the consequences,
the bishop sent on the catechumen to the Armenian priests
at Calcutta, who, equally afraid that the news would reach
the Persian authorities, handed him over to the Rev. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>E.C.
Stuart, then the Church Missionary Society&rsquo;s secretary
there, and a Persian scholar, now Bishop of Waiapu. Mr.
Stuart took him as his guest, found that he delighted in
instruction in the New Testament, and baptized him. Ultimately
the convert went back to Persia as one who &lsquo;had
gained a sincere faith in Christ from the simple reading
of H. Martyn&rsquo;s Persian Testament.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In 1842 the learned Bombay chaplain, George Percy
Badger, visited Tokat on a mission from the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Bishop of London to the Nestorian
tribes of Koordistan. He was guided to Henry Martyn&rsquo;s
first tomb by the Armenian priest who had performed the
rites of Christian burial. While Mrs. Badger sought out
and planted wild flowers around the stone, her husband,
recalling the fervent zeal and ardent piety of the departed,
&lsquo;lifted up a secret prayer that God in His mercy would
raise up many of a like spirit to labour among the benighted
Mohammedans of the East.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Adopting the report of their missionaries in 1830, the
American Board at Boston sent out Dr. Henry J. van
Lennep, who first visited Tokat fourteen years after them,
and thirty-two years after Henry Martyn&rsquo;s death. The first
object of his attention was the grave, which then he had
great difficulty in discovering and identifying. It was this
experience, and not any earlier facts, that must have led to
the publication of these lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">No stone marks the spot where these ashes are resting,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">No tear has e&rsquo;er hallowed thy cold, lonely grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But the wild warring winds whistle round thy bleak dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And the fierce wintry torrent sweeps o&rsquo;er it with its wave.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>
<p>In his <i>Travels in Little Known Parts of Asia Minor</i>,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
Dr. van Lennep writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Armenian burying-ground, where he was laid, is
situated just outside of the town, and hard by the wretched
gipsy quarter which forms its eastern extremity. It is a
most barren and desolate spot, overhung by lofty cliffs of
clay slate. Its only verdure, besides the rank weeds that
spring up between the thickly set graves, consists of two
scraggy wild pear-trees nearly dead for lack of moisture.
The sexton of the church near by could give no information,
and I was left to search for it alone. Beginning at
the graves lying at the outer edge of the ground nearest
the road, I advanced towards the hill, examining each in
its turn, until just at the foot of the overhanging cliffs I
came upon a slab of coarse limestone, some forty inches by
twenty, bearing the following inscription:</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 90%;">

</p>


<p>It was just ten years after this first visit that I was
again in Tokat, not on a transient visit, but with the
purpose of making that city my permanent abode. A
little party of us soon repaired to the hallowed spot.
Guided by my recollections and a drawing made at my
previous visit, we were soon at the place; but in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
few years it had undergone a remarkable change. Instead
of the slab of stone with its inscription, which we expected
to see, we only found a smooth surface of pebbly and sandy
soil overgrown with weeds, without vestige of stone or
mound to indicate the presence of a grave; but the identical
surroundings were there, too well remembered to be
mistaken. Could it be that, as happens in these lawless
regions, the stone had been removed by some ruthless
hand and incorporated in the wall of a neighbouring
building? We could not accept that unpleasant conclusion,
and, calling the sexton, we directed him to dig where we
pointed. It was at a depth of two feet from the surface
that the stone came into view: the soil and rubbish accumulated
upon the grave were then removed, and we hoped
the place would hereafter need little attention. But, to our
surprise, we found it again, the ensuing spring, covered to
the same depth as before. The soil was washed upon it by
the rains from the whole mountain side, and we found that
were a wall built for its protection, the gipsy boys, who
made this their playground, would soon have it down.</p>

<p>Some time after this, a correspondence took place with
friends in London, which resulted in a grant being made by
the late Hon. East India Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors,
for the purpose of erecting a more suitable monument to
the memory of Henry Martyn, to be placed with his remains
in the Mission Burying-ground. The monument
was cut out of native marble, and made by native workmen
at Tokat. The remains were removed under the inspection
of the missionary physician, and though it was difficult
positively to identify them, there can be no doubt that what
was found once formed a portion of the earthly tenement
of the devoted and lamented missionary. There were no
remains of a coffin; Orientals never use them, and he was
doubtless laid in immediate contact with the soil, literally
&lsquo;dust to dust.&rsquo; The monument under which we laid these
remains was the first grave in our little cemetery, and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
might it be said that it became sacred ground. The
obelisk has four faces, on each of which the name, encircled
with a wreath, is cut, severally in English, Armenian,
Persian, and Turkish. The four sides of the base contain
the following inscription in the same languages:</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;" class="smcap">
<span style="font-size: 110%;">REV. HENRY MARTYN, M.A.</span><br /><br />

Chaplain of the Hon. East India Company,<br />
Born at Truro, England, February 18, 1781,<br />
Died at Tokat, October 16, 1812.<br /><br />

He laboured for many years in the East, striving to<br />
Benefit mankind both in this world and that to come.<br />
He translated the Holy Scriptures into Hindostanee<br />
and Persian,<br />
And preached the God and Saviour of whom they testify.<br />
He will long be remembered in the East, where he was<br />
known as a Man of God.<br />
</p>

<p>The grave now lies in a spot every way adapted to
foster the holy memories which it recalls. It stands upon
a broad and high terrace, overlooking the whole city for
whose salvation we cannot doubt that he offered some of
the last petitions &lsquo;of the righteous man, which avail much.&rsquo;
It is a solitude, immediately surrounded by the thick
foliage of fruit trees, among which tall walnuts are conspicuous.
We ourselves planted by its side the only weeping
willows which exist in the whole region. The place is
visited by many, who read the concise inscription and
further inquire into the good man&rsquo;s history. It has always
been a favourite place of resort of our students and native
Christians, and they have many a time sat under its shade
and expounded to wondering strangers the very doctrines
to propagate which that model of a missionary had sacrificed
his life.</p></div>

<p>Tokat is now for ever memorable as the centre which
links the names of Basiliscus, the martyr, Basil the Great,
John Chrysostom, and Henry Martyn. The cloud-crested
fortress points almost straight up from the Jeshil-Irmak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>river, the ancient Iris, which, rising in the Anti-Taurus
range of Pontus, finds its way to the Black Sea with a
breadth and volume of water second only to the Halys.
Still, as of old, the town crowds about the foot of the two
spiral crags and straggles out with towered church, mosque
and minaret, into the valley. The ruins of the embattled
walls crowning every pinnacle of the insulated rocks of
which they seem to form a part, tell of the days when
Greek and Roman passed along the &lsquo;royal road&rsquo; from
Amisos or Samsoon on the Euxine to Sebaste, Caesareia,
and Central Asia; and when the Saracens beat off the
Emperor Michael (860) from what was then called
Daximon.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The time is coming when there shall once
more be here a highway of civilisation after the barren
centuries of the Moslem.</p>

<p>Tokat represents Komana Pontica, six miles off, the
oracle and emporium of the royal road, described by Strabo
as a little Corinth for vice and traffic. Another step,
and the Apostle Paul himself might have visited it from
Galatia. In 312, in the persecution under Maximin, Basiliscus,
the bishop of Komana, was martyred, being shod
with red-hot iron shoes, beheaded, and thrown into the
Iris. The <i>Acta</i> picture the saint as led on foot by soldiers
along the road without food for four days, till he reached
Komana; &lsquo;and the road was much the same as the
modern way, Tokat to Amaseia,&rsquo; along which Henry
Martyn was violently hurried by his Tartar. In the
martyrium, built a few miles out of Komana, in memory
of Basiliscus, Chrysostom found rest in death, and a
grave.</p>

<p>Basilius, the bishop of Caesareia, belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
neighbouring province of Cappadocia, but his missionary
influence, and that of his bishop brother, Gregory Nyssen,
and his sister, Macrina, spread all over Pontus, while
Gregory Nazianzen was his fellow-student at Athens, and his
admiring friend, as Julian also, the future Emperor, was for
a time. Like Martyn, Basil owed to his sister his conversion,
his call to the ministry, and his self-sacrifice all through
life. It was on the banks of the Iris above Tokat that,
secluded for five years, the great Father laid the foundation
of the monastic communities of the Greek Church,
and learned to be the future defender of orthodoxy against
the Arians, and of the unity of the Oriental Church.</p>

<p>But it is the exile and death of John Chrysostom, just
fourteen centuries before, that form the most touching
parallel to the sufferings of Henry Martyn. Never has
there been a greater missionary bishop than the &lsquo;golden-mouthed&rsquo;
preacher of Antioch and Constantinople. The
victim first of a cabal of bishops, and then of the Empress
Eudoxia, whose vices and sacrilege he rebuked, he was
driven from Constantinople to the scorching plains of
Cappadocia in the midsummer heat. His guard drove on
the venerable man day and night, giving him no rest.
When a halt was made, it was always in some filthy village
where good water was not. Fever and ague were provoked,
but still he was forced on to Basil&rsquo;s city of Caesareia,
to find Basil&rsquo;s successor his bitter enemy. Taking a
physician with him he reached his destination at Kokussos,
where the Empress had hoped that the barbarians would
make an end of him. As it seemed likely to prove his
Tabreez, he was once more driven forth on foot, under two
guards selected for their brutality. It took him three
months to reach Komana&mdash;one long, slow martyrdom to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
the fever-stricken old man. &lsquo;It was evident that Chrysostom&rsquo;s
strength was entirely worn out,&rsquo; writes Canon
Venables, in words which exactly describe the experience
of the young Henry Martyn. &lsquo;But his pitiless guard
hurried him through the town &ldquo;as if its streets were no
more than a bridge,&rdquo; without a moment&rsquo;s halt.&rsquo; Five miles
farther on they halted at the chapel of the martyr
Basiliscus, of whom Chrysostom dreamed that he saw him
and heard him say: &lsquo;Be of good cheer; on the morrow
we shall be together.&rsquo; Canon Venables continues, unconsciously,
the parallel with the experience of the nineteenth-century
saint of the Evangel:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the morning Chrysostom earnestly begged for a
brief respite, but in vain. He was hurried off, but scarcely
had he gone three or four miles when a violent attack of
fever compelled them to retrace their steps.</p></div>

<p>On reaching the martyrium, Chrysostom, led within,
stripped on his soiled garments, clothed himself in white
baptismal vestments, joined in the communion of the
body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, offered his last
prayer &lsquo;for present needs,&rsquo; uttered his accustomed doxology:
&lsquo;Glory be to God for all things,&rsquo; and, having said &lsquo;Amen,&rsquo;
breathed his last on September 14, 407, in his sixtieth
year. His body was laid beside that of Basiliscus. A
generation after, the children of the Empress and Emperor
who had thus slaughtered the saint brought back his body
and gave it imperial sepulture in Constantinople, while
they publicly asked Heaven to forgive the wrong of the
past.</p>

<p>From Basiliscus, Basil, and Chrysostom to Henry
Martyn, the fourteen centuries tell of the corruption of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
Church of Christ in the East, and the rise upon its ruins
of Mohammedanism, which covered the northern half of
Africa, and Spain, and reached as far as Tours and Vienna
in Europe. It is to the glory of Henry Martyn that he
was the first missionary of the Reformed Church of the
West to the Mohammedans, giving those of India and
Central Asia the Gospel and the Psalms in two of their
own vernaculars, and dying for them before he could complete
his work at the Arabic Bible.</p>

<p>We shall see whom his example inspired to follow him.
His death became a summons, first to his own evangelical
circle in England and India, and then to the whole Church
of Christ, to follow in the path that he marked out alike
by his toiling and his writing.</p>

<p>Sergius, the Armenian, must at once have pursued the
journey from Tokat to Constantinople, which is distant
from Tabreez 1,542 miles, and not 1,300 as roundly estimated
by Henry Martyn. He presented the letters of his
master to Mr. Isaac Morier, in the Sultan&rsquo;s capital, father
of Sir Gore Ouseley&rsquo;s secretary and successor. On
February 12, 1813, Charles Simeon wrote thus to Mr.
Thomason in Calcutta:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The day before yesterday a letter arrived from
Mr. Isaac Morier, of Constantinople, announcing that on
October 16 (or thereabouts) our beloved brother entered
into the realms of glory, and rested for ever in the bosom
of his God.... But what an event it is! How calamitous
to his friends, to India, and to the world! Methinks I
hear God say: &lsquo;Be still and know that I am God.&rsquo; ...
I had been forming plans in my mind with a view to the
restoration of his health in England, and should now have
been able to carry into execution whatever might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
been judged expedient; but I am denied the joy of
ministering to him!</p></div>

<p>Again on April 2:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We are making collections for Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s
family, who in him have lost their main support. We have
got about 400<i>l.</i>, and Mr. Thornton has sent you a paper
for the purpose of getting them some aid in India.</p></div>

<p>The news reached Lydia Grenfell on February 14, 1813.
She was then for a fortnight at Marazion, where every spot
recalled the past. She thus communed with herself and
God in her <i>Diary</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date">
Marazion: February 20, 1813.<br />
</p>

<p>I am fearful to retrace the last week on two accounts,
lest the infirmity of nature prevail, and I give way to
sorrow,&mdash;and lest, in recollecting the wondrous kindness
and love of God my Saviour, I increase my pride and not
my gratitude. Oh, shall I then remain silent? Shall Thy
mercies be forgotten? Teach me, O Lord, to write and
speak for Thy glory, and to my own deeper humiliation.
Heard on the 14th of the removal of my most tender,
faithful, and beloved friend to the joys of heaven. Oh, I
could not wish his absence from them prolonged. What I
only wished was, and now I am reconciled to that too,&mdash;I
wished to have been honoured of God so far as to have
been near him, or that some friend had been.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Lord, if
this was wrong, forgive me. I will endeavour, yea, I am
enabled to say of this too, &lsquo;Thy will be done.&rsquo; Great has
been the peace and tranquillity of my soul, such nearness
to God, such a hold of Christ, such hope in the promises,
such assurance of bliss and immortality, as I cannot
express, and may have to forget. Oh, that I may never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
lose,&mdash;rather would I lose everything I most prize, every
earthly friend, every earthly enjoyment, than this. Oh,
the fear of doing so, or of the abatement of spiritual perceptions
and affections, is the thing I most dread, and
makes me long to die. It is not for the sake of rejoining
that blessed spirit of my friend, though I have, and do,
feel that too,&mdash;but to be again shut out from Thy possession
is what I fear.</p>

<p><i>February 28.</i>&mdash;A silent Sabbath, at least to me,&mdash;to my
ears, I should say, for I trust God speaks to my heart.
&lsquo;Comfort ye, comfort ye, My people,&rsquo; enables me to take
comfort. I feel a submission to the will of God which is
more blessed than when I had my own in the ministry of
the Word,&mdash;yet this is a time which calls for prayer. Lord,
pour out the spirit of prayer on me and many, and grant
us grace to ask, fervently yet resignedly, the restoration of
Thy preached gospel. Suddenly are we deprived of it,&mdash;may
it be as quickly restored. Very weak in health, so
powerless this morning,&mdash;I could not but think my earthly
bed was preparing for me too, and that my soul would
soon return to God, but I am better, and willing to stay my
appointed time. True, to perform my work in a little
time might be what I should rejoice in, but I am willing
to live, so I may have the presence of God with me, and
be engaged in His service. I have a pleasure in supposing
it possible the blessed spirit of my friend may be, on some
occasions, sent to protect, to console, and counsel me,&mdash;but
this is a weakness, and perhaps should not be indulged.
I felt this afternoon as if he was present, as I sat alone in
the garden,&mdash;the thought only disposed me to solemnity
and pensiveness of mind. I am afraid of my dependence
on the creature, whether embodied or not, and I will rather
trust to the sure support of God&rsquo;s Word.</p>

<p><i>March 2.</i>&mdash;Some sorrowful thoughts will enter my
mind respecting my late dear friend, and call forth some
sighs and tears from my heart,&mdash;yet is that heart resigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
to the will of God, and confident of His having done all
things well for His beloved servant. Oh, how shall I, with
wonder and praise, listen in eternity to the relation of his
last days! The excess of affection now, and the unwillingness
I feel that he should have suffered, make it amongst
my mercies that a veil is drawn over that period of his
life. It is mercy all, and God is good to me in everything.
I see His hand, I love and I adore. I submit and resign
myself to His blessed disposal and to all His dispensations.
I have been thinking how necessary for me it was that we
are thus separated; for during his life I felt such a desire
to please and to be worthy of the regard he entertained
for me, that it was my bane, and caused me to forget God
as the first object I was to think of and please. I accept
the punishment sent for this offence, may it prove an
effectual cure of this evil in my heart!</p>

<p><i>March 8.</i>&mdash;During the last few days I have experienced
much of the Divine support and consolation of the Gospel.
It has been a time of conflict, not inward, blessed be the
name of the Lord. I have enjoyed a constant, uninterrupted
peace, a peace past an understanding, unless experienced.
I never was more sensible of, or rejoiced more in the
presence of God, and my heart rises to my Maker with
delight and joy, as easily as I breathe. God, &lsquo;as soon as
sought, is found,&rsquo; through Jesus Christ,&mdash;but I have been
put into the hands of a bitter enemy, and that enemy....
She has left me, and I pray that every uneasy feeling
excited in my breast by her unkind and injurious treatment
may depart with her. Oh, how I rejoice that no storms
can molest the dead who die in the Lord,&mdash;they rest from
their labours of every kind. Since the account reached
me of the departure of my dear friend to be with Christ,
which is far better than to be here,&mdash;every evil I suffer, or
fear, is blessed in its purpose, from knowing he can never
feel the same; and all I enjoy or behold that is delightful,
is the more enjoyed from thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span> &lsquo;he has all this, and
more, in perfection, and without interruption.&rsquo; May I
accomplish my work of suffering, or ending, or labouring,
and then enter into rest.</p>

<p><i>March 13.</i>&mdash;Nature has its turn in my feelings. To-day
I have been given to feel more of sorrow for the
removal of my beloved friend, and, without desiring it to
be otherwise, to mourn my own loss. The recollection of
his unmerited kindness softens my heart, and I can hardly
forbear indulging a tenderness which may weaken but
cannot strengthen my mind. O Lord, I beseech Thee
preserve me from whatever may injure my soul and unfit
me for Thy service. I have the hope of heaven too, and
that is enough. In heaven we shall meet and unite for
ever in the work of praise. Life, with its trials and cares,
will be but short. May I only desire to live to Thee, my
God, and finish the work Thou hast given me to do.
Lord, make me faithful, self-denying, and submissive to
Thy will.</p>

<p><i>April 3.</i>&mdash;My thoughts revert to the possible circumstances
of my late dear friend&rsquo;s sufferings and death, and
I am sunk low by doing so. It was the last step he had
to travel below, and one necessary to be taken, in order to
reach the heights of glory. There let me view him
triumphing with his Saviour, and through His meritorious
sufferings and death made more than conqueror over all
his enemies. I must think more of his glorious Lord, and
less of the servant, either as suffering and labouring or
glorified and resting. Lord, be graciously present, and in
the contemplation of Thy perfections, and the review of
Thy mercies, let me forget everything beside.</p>

<p><i>April 21.</i>&mdash;A letter from Tabreez, dated August 28,
reached me. O Thou who readest my heart, direct and
sanctify every feeling. May the anguish of my soul be
moderated, and let me endeavour to exercise faith in Thy
Divine goodness, mercy, and power, and to believe it was
well with him in all respects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span></p>

<p><i>April 24.</i>&mdash;I am tormented with fears that even in
eternity I shall never be capable of enjoying the same
happiness my departed friend does, and it seems as if no
other would satisfy me. O Lord Jesus, weary and heavy
laden I come to Thee; let me behold the light of Thy
countenance, and praise Thee, and lose in the contemplation
of Thy glories, and in the sense of Thy love to my soul,&mdash;let
me lose the remembrance of every other excellence.
When the sun shines the light of the stars is eclipsed;
thus may it be with me!&mdash;Unless the genius which shone
in his character make me admire and love God more, let
me turn from viewing them. Oh, teach me to love Thy
saints, whether living or dead, and for Thy sake and Thyself
above them all. I have never felt I was not resigned
to the will of God in our separation on earth, but my
anxious mind dwells on another, which I cannot bear to
think possible.</p>

<p><i>June 3.</i>&mdash;For several days my mind has been occupied
with recollections that weaken its hold of spiritual things.
I think more of a departed saint than of the King of
Saints. It is strange that now I should be more in danger
of loving too well a creature passed into the skies than
when he lived on earth. But so it is,&mdash;continually my
thoughts revert to him. I pray God this may not be a
snare unto me to divide me from Himself. Let me behold
Jesus.</p>

<p><i>June 13.</i>&mdash;Passed a very blessed Sabbath. My soul
quickened,&mdash;Oh, let it live, and it shall praise Thee! A
letter from my dearest Emma containing wholesome,
though at first unwelcome, counsel, has been of singular
use to me. The snare is seen, if not broken. Yes, I have
lost my hold of everything that used, and ought, to support
me by allowing, without restraint, the remembrance of my
late dear friend to fill my mind. My almost constant
thoughts were of him, and pride at the preference he
showed me was fed, as well as affection. Now I have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
painful, difficult part to act. A sacrifice I must offer of
what has become so much my happiness as to interfere
with my enjoyment of God. I must fly from the recollection
of an earthly object, loved too well, viewed too much.
Let me follow his faith, and consider the end of his conversation,&mdash;Jesus
Christ, the same for ever. I have had
the greatest peace to-day in only trying to resolve on this,&mdash;how
merciful is God!</p>

<p><i>1814, January 28.</i>&mdash;Found great sweetness yesterday
and to-day in reading and sweet prayer in the garden;
was sensibly refreshed in the exercise, and had a taste that
the Lord was gracious. This evening my heart is sad, not
from the withdrawing of those consolations, or darkness of
soul, as is often the case, but from having the circumstances
of my revered friend&rsquo;s death brought to my recollection.
I strive not to dwell on them, for oh, what a scope do they
give to my busy fancy! I would fly from this subject as
too high for me, and take refuge in this: the Lord did not
forsake His servant, and precious was his death in His
sight. Nature is weak, but faith can strengthen me.</p>

<p><i>February 12.</i>&mdash;A twelvemonth, this day, since I heard of
the death of my dear friend. My thoughts revert to this event,
but more to the mercies of God to me at that season.</p>

<p><i>October 16.</i>&mdash;My thoughts engaged often to-day by the
event of this day in 1812. Twice has the earth performed
its annual round since the honoured servant of God received
the welcome mandate to cease from his labours, and join
those who &lsquo;see His face&rsquo; and &lsquo;serve Him,&rsquo; unencumbered
with flesh and blood. He no longer measures time by days
and years, and there is no tedious six days between
Sabbath and Sabbath, as it is here. &lsquo;How blessed are
those who die in the Lord.&rsquo; This expresses my feelings
most at the remembrance of this departed saint. May I
abide in Christ, and be with Him and His saints for ever.
O blessed hope of everlasting life,&mdash;I will cherish it, exult
in it, and may I pursue till I attain it.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p>It was April 18, 1813, when Corrie and Thomason in
India learned what they had always feared since the dearest
of all friends to them had passed through Calcutta on his
way to Arabia. Corrie was at Agra, and he wrote to his
brother-in-law, Mr. C. Shaw, in reply to a letter &lsquo;containing
the affecting intelligence of Martyn&rsquo;s death, to us afflictive,
to him happy beyond expression. I could find nothing
but lamentations to express&mdash;lamentations for us, not for
him. He was meet for &ldquo;the inheritance of the saints in light.&rdquo;
My master is taken from me; oh, for a double portion of
his spirit! The work of printing and distributing the
Scriptures will henceforth go on more slowly.&rsquo; Again, to
Simeon: &lsquo;Could he look from heaven and see the Abdool
Massee&rsquo;h, with the translated New Testament in his hand,
preaching to the listening throng, ... it would add fresh
delight to his holy soul.&rsquo; Thomason, at once his disciple
and his friend, wrote: &lsquo;He was in our hearts; we honoured
him; we loved him; we thanked God for him; we prayed
for his longer continuance amongst us; we rejoiced in the
good he was doing. We are sadly bereaved. Where such
fervent piety, and extensive knowledge, and vigorous understanding,
and classical taste, and unwearied application
were all united, what might not have been expected?&rsquo;
When, soon after, Thomason, as chaplain, accompanied the
Governor-General, Lord Moira, through North India, and
arrived at Cawnpore, he had eyes and thoughts only for
his friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span> &lsquo;In these sandy plains I have been tracing
again and again the days of Martyn. Close by me is the
house that dear minister occupied, leading to which is the
gloomy line of aloes spoken of by Mrs. Sherwood.... Oh,
for Martyn&rsquo;s humility and love!... His standard of every
duty was the highest, and his feelings of joy, sorrow, love,
most intense; whilst his conversation was always in heaven,
the savour of his holy disposition was as ointment poured
forth.... Woe unto us if we do not pray more, live more
above the world and deny ourselves more, and love Christ
more!&rsquo;</p>

<p>John Sargent, Rector of Lavington, the earliest of Henry
Martyn&rsquo;s intimate friends, at once undertook to write a
memoir of his life, for which Simeon charged himself with
collecting &lsquo;all possible materials from India and Persia.&rsquo;
Bishop Corrie accordingly addressed Sargent thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date">
Agra: November 1, 1813.<br />
</p>

<p>It will be of use for you to know that when he left
Cawnpore in 1810 to seek change of air I was with him,
and persuaded him to leave in my hands a number of
memorandums he was about to destroy. They were sealed
up, but on his death, being opened, they proved to be
journals of the exercises of his mind from January 1803 to
1807 inclusive. They seem to me no less worthy of
publication than the journal of Mr. Brainerd, if more books
of that kind should be judged necessary. Since the
beginning of 1807 Mr. Martyn favoured me with almost
a weekly letter, in which his various employments and
engagements for the furtherance of the Gospel in this
country are detailed, with occasional very interesting
remarks. This correspondence ceased on my being
ordered by our Commander-in-chief to assist Mr. Martyn
in the duties of the station of Cawnpore, when I took up
my abode with him from June till his departure, October 1.
Other letters passed between us after that time, and it is
my intention to send you copies of all the above correspondence,
together with his private memorandums. The
latter, with copies of Martyn&rsquo;s letters from February to
July 1807, were sent off this day to Mr. Thomason in
Calcutta, to be forwarded to England by the first oppor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>tunity,
and the copies of the remaining letters shall follow
as soon as may be. Of course I have omitted to copy
what seems purely personal: yet much remains which you
will perhaps judge unnecessary for publication, and will
exercise your own judgment on that head. All the
extracts seem to me, however, to cast light on the progress
of missionary work in this land, and may perhaps be
thought interesting to those who take a concern in Indian
affairs. These extracts give so full a view of Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s
character that nothing remains for me to add. Only I may
say a more perfect character I never met with, nor expect
to see again on earth. During the four years we were
fellow-labourers in this country, I had no less than six
opportunities of enjoying his company; the last time for
four months together, and under the same roof all the time;
and each opportunity only increased my love and veneration
for him.</p>

<p>I conclude the above intelligence will plead my excuse
for writing to you without previous introduction, and I was
anxious it should reach you through the nearest channel.
Your brother in Calcutta has told me several times of your
welfare, and during beloved Martyn&rsquo;s life I used to hear of
you sometimes. Your person, whilst a student at King&rsquo;s
College, was well known to me, and your character admired,
though I had not steadiness of principle sufficient at that
time to imitate you, and consequently had no pretensions to
an acquaintance with you, though I often greatly desired it.
To that &lsquo;Father in Israel,&rsquo; Mr. Simeon, I owe all my
comfort on earth and all my hopes respecting eternity: for
through his instrumentality the seeds of grace, I trust, were,
during my residence at Cambridge, especially during the
latter part of my residence, implanted in my heart, and have
influenced, though alas! unsteadily, my after days.</p></div>

<p>Lydia Grenfell was of course consulted as the work made
progress, but none of her letters to Martyn have seen the light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1815, December 26.</i>&mdash;Wrote this day to Mr. Simeon. I
have reason to search into my heart and watch the risings
of pride there, both respecting the notice of this blessed
saint, and the avowal to be expected of my being the
object of so much regard from another still more eminent
in the Church of Christ. I have ever stood amazed at
this, and now that in the providence of God it seems
certain that my being so favoured is likely to be made
known, vanity besets me. Oh, how poor a creature am I!
Lord, I pray, let me be enabled to trace some evidence of
Thine eternal love to me, and let this greater wonder call
off my thoughts from every other distinction. But how
do I learn that in the whole of this notice my thoughts
have not indeed been Thine, O Lord, nor my ways Thy
ways? How much above all I could have conceived of
have been the designs of God! I sought concealment, and
lo! all is made known to many, and much will be even
known to the world. It is strange for me to credit this,
and strange that, with my natural reserve and the peculiar
reasons that exist for my wishing to have this buried in
silence, I am nevertheless composed about it. But, Lord,
I would resign myself, and all things that concern me, to
Thy sovereign will and pleasure. Preserve me blameless
to Thine eternal kingdom, and grant me an everlasting
union with thy servant above.</p>

<p><i>1816, January 28.</i>&mdash;I feel an increased thankfulness
that God has called me to live free from the many cares
which fall on all in the married state, and for the peculiarly
favourable circumstances He has placed me in here. The
privilege of watching over my mother in the decline of life,
the charge of a sweet child, the occupation of the schools,
and a portion of this world&rsquo;s goods for the use of the poor,&mdash;all,
all call for more thankfulness and diligence. Lord,
help me to abound in both, and with and above all I have
peace and hope in God through Jesus Christ, in a measure&mdash;though
unbelief often robs my soul of both. Oh, let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
seek the grace of steadfast faith, and I have all I want or
desire.</p>

<p><i>April 21.</i>&mdash;Thought with delight of my loved friends,
Mrs. Hoare and H.M., both before the Throne, led by the
Lamb to living fountains of waters, and all tears wiped
away from their eyes. Oh, I long to be there; yet I could
willingly forego the joys of heaven if I might, by suffering
or labours here, glorify my Lord and Saviour.</p>

<p><i>June 30.</i>&mdash;Often have I thought, when desirous of pursuing
a more consistent deportment, and of introducing
spiritual subjects: &lsquo;How can I appear so different before
those I have been so trifling and merely worldly in all my
intercourse with?&rsquo; The death of my esteemed and beloved
brother in Christ, H.M., I thought would have been the
period for my maintaining that serious watchfulness so
essential to my enjoyment of God; but no, I have been
worse since, I think, as a judgment for failing in my keeping
my resolution.</p></div>

<p>In 1817 Lydia Grenfell&rsquo;s <i>Diary</i> records the visits of such
men as Mr. Fenn, &lsquo;who came to preach in the great cause
of the Church Missionary Society,&rsquo; and of Mr. Bickersteth,
who at Penzance &lsquo;stated what he had met with in Africa.&rsquo;
The author of many immortal hymns, Francis Thomas
Lyte, &lsquo;opened his ministry&rsquo; of two years in Marazion at
this time, to her joy and spiritual growth. She notes on
August 31, 1817, that his hymn &lsquo;Penitence&rsquo; was sung for
the first time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date">
Marazion: March 6, 1819.<br />
</p>

<p>Received, a few days since, Mr. Sargent&rsquo;s Memoir,
and reading only a few pages has convinced me that,
without a greater resemblance in the spirit to our friend,
I never can partake of that blessedness now enjoyed by the
happy subject of it in the presence of his Saviour. It is
chiefly in humility, meekness, and love I see the sad, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
total difference. This may be traced to a departure from
the fountain of grace, Christ Jesus, to whom, oh, may I
return, and I shall be replenished.</p>

<p><i>October 14.</i>&mdash;Indulged a wandering imagination, and am
sad in consequence. This season I ought to deem a sacred
one. Oh, that, in my remembrance of Thy blessed ...
and servant, I could entirely forget what feeds my vanity.
Lord, help me to check all earthly sorrow at the recollection
of his many sorrows, for were they not the appointed
means of fitting him for his present felicity, and of manifesting
Thy grace, by which Thou art glorified? I would
make this season one of serious preparation for my own
departure, and what does that preparation consist in?&mdash;faith
in Jesus. Oh, strengthen it in me, and by following
Thy blessed saint in all virtuous and godly living I may
come to those eternal joys prepared for those that love
Thee.</p>

<p><i>1820, June 25.</i>&mdash;Oh, what a heaven for a creature, who has
no strength, or wisdom, or righteousness, like myself, to be
fixed in, beholding the glories of Jehovah manifested in Him
who is my Saviour and my Lord. Gladly would I part from
this dull clod of earth and come to Thee, and reach the
pure pleasures of a spiritual state. There, there dwells the
blessed Martyn, who bows before the throne, of a glorious
company of saints, washed with him, and clothed in spotless
robes. Oh, (that) I may be brought to them.</p>

<p><i>December 5.</i>&mdash;Thought of the holy martyr, so humble,
so self-denying, so devoted, and of his early-accomplished
prayer for the heavenly country, where he dwells perfect in
purity and love. Oh, to be a follower of him as he followed
Christ, and to walk in the same paths, influenced by the
same holy, humble, heavenly principles, upheld by the
same arm of omnipotent grace, till I too reach the rest
above.</p>

<p><i>1821, January 23.</i>&mdash;Elevated rather than refreshed and
humbled in worship to-day. Imagination has been too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
active and unrestrained. The remembrance of past events,
in which that blessed saint now with God, H.M. (? figured),
has been filling my mind. This should not be. This is
not communion with him, now a glorified spirit, but merely
the indulgence of a vain, sinful imagination. I would turn
from all, from the most holy creatures, to the Holy One,
and the just; spiritual, and moral, yea, Divine glory and
beauty I may behold in Him, who is the chief among ten
thousand, and altogether lovely.</p>

<p><i>October 18.</i>&mdash;I have now survived my beloved friend
eight years. Eight years have been given me to be prepared
for that world of blessedness he has so long entered
upon. Alas! I seem less so now than at any period.</p>

<p><i>1822, October 16.</i>&mdash;The remembrance of the event of
the day has been rendered useless by my absence from
home a great part of it. It should be the occasion for
renewed self-dedication, of more earnest prayer, and of
humiliation; for the recollection of being the cause of
increased sufferings to Thy saint, O Lord, is cause for constant
humiliation. I would realise death, and look to
eternity, and to that glorious Saviour, for whom the blessed
subject of my thoughts lived only to serve and honour. Oh,
never more shall I have intercourse with the beloved friend
now with Christ, but by faith in Christ. Lord, help me to
use the recollection of our earthly regard to promote this
end.</p>

<p><i>October 19.</i>&mdash;My birthday (forty-seventh) follows that
of the anniversary of the death of Martyn.</p>

<p><i>December 31.</i>&mdash;Read dear Martyn&rsquo;s sermon on the
Christian&rsquo;s walk with greater enjoyment and unction than
has been vouchsafed unto me for a long season. The
holy simplicity of the directions, and persuasive motives
to walk in, as well as receive, Christ, had influence in my
heart.</p>

<p><i>1823, January 11.</i>&mdash;Placed in my room yesterday the
print of dear M. Felt affected greatly in doing so, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
my tears, which seldom flow in the presence of anyone,
I could not restrain before the person who was fixing it.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
With the Saviour now, and the Saviour, doubtless, was
with him in his greatest agony, even the agony of death&mdash;this
thought will be the more familiar to me by viewing
the representation of Christ&rsquo;s Crucifixion, now placed over
the picture of His servant. I trust, by a prudent and not too
frequent sight of both, I may derive some advantage from
possessing what is so affecting and so admonitory to me,
who am declining in religious fervour and spirituality.
Thus may I use both, not to exercise feelings, but faith.
I cannot behold the resemblance of M. but I am reminded
that God wrought powerfully on his soul, meeting him for
a state of purity, and love, and spiritual enjoyment, and
that he has entered upon it. His faithfulness, and diligence,
and self-denial, and devotedness; his love to God,
and love for souls; his meekness, and patience, and faith,
should stimulate me to earnestness in prayer for a portion
of that grace, through which alone he attained them, and
was what he was.</p>

day, and by a messenger unexpected, and beloved as a

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="subheading">BAPTIZED FOR THE DEAD</p>


<p>Henry Martyn is, first of all, a spiritual force. Personally
he was that to all who came in contact with him from
the hour in which he gave himself to Jesus Christ. To
Cambridge student and peasant alike; to Charles Simeon,
his master, as to Kirke White and Sargent, Corrie and
Thomason, his admiring friends; to women like Lydia
Grenfell, his senior in years and experience, as to children
like his cousin&rsquo;s at Plymouth, and David Brown&rsquo;s at Aldeen;
to the rude soldiery of the Cape campaign and the East
India Company&rsquo;s raw recruits as to the cultured statesmen
and scholars who were broadening the foundations of our
Indian empire; to the caste-bound Hindu, but far more
to the fanatical Arab and the Mohammedan mystic of
Persia&mdash;to all he carried the witness of his saintly life and
his Divine message with a simple power that always compelled
attention, and often drew forth obedience and
imitation. His meteor-like spirit burned and flamed as
it passed across the first twelve years of the nineteenth
century, from the Cam to the Fal, by Brazil and South
Africa, by Calcutta and Serampore, by Patna and Cawnpore,
by Bombay and Muscat, by Bushire and Shiraz and
Tabreez, to the loneliness of the Armenian highlands, and
the exile grave of the Turkish Tokat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span></p>

<p>From the year in which Sargent published fragments
of his <i>Journal</i>, and half revealed to the whole Church
of Christ the personality known in its deep calling unto
deep only to the few, Henry Martyn has been the companion
of good men<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and women of all the Churches, and
the stimulus of the greatest workers and scholars of the
century. The latest writer, the Hon. George N. Curzon,
M.P., in his exhaustive work on Persia (1892), describes
him as &lsquo;this remarkable man, who impressed everyone,
by his simplicity and godliness of character,&rsquo; though he
ascribes the &lsquo;effect in the short space of a year&rsquo; as much to
the charm of his personality as to the character of his mission.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most representative of the many whom
Martyn is known to have influenced was Daniel Wilson,
of Islington and Calcutta. When visiting his vast diocese
in 1838 and crossing the Bay of Bengal, Bishop Wilson<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
thus carefully compared the <i>Journal</i> with corresponding
passages in his own life:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is consoling to a poor sinner like myself, who has
been placed in the full bustle of public business, to see
how the soul even of a saint like H. Martyn faints and
is discouraged, laments over defects of love, and finds an
evil nature still struggling against the law of his mind.
I remember there are similar confessions in J. Milner. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
this which explains the seventh of Romans. Henry
Martyn has now been in heaven twenty-six years, having
died in his thirty-second year. Dearest Corrie was born
like myself in 1778, and died in 1837, aged fifty-nine, and
after having been thirty-one years in India. He has been
at home now a year and five months. When, where, how,
I may be called hence I know not. The Lord make
me a follower of them who through faith and patience
have inherited the promises. In H. Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journals</i> the
spirit of prayer, the time he devoted to the duty, and his
fervour in it, are the first things which strike me. In the
next place, his delight in Holy Scripture, his meditations
in it, the large portions he committed to memory, the
nourishment he thence derived to his soul, are full of
instruction. Then his humility is quite undoubted, unfeigned,
profound, sincere. There seems, however, to have
been a touch of natural melancholy and depression, which
was increased by one of his greatest mistakes, the leaving
England with his affections tied to Lydia Grenfell, whom
he ought either not to have loved or else to have married
and taken her with him. Such an ecstatic, warm creature
as Henry Martyn could do nothing by halves. Separation
was martyrdom to such a tender heart. But, oh, to imitate
his excellences, his elevation of piety, his diligence, his
spirituality, his superiority to the world, his love for souls,
his anxiety to improve all occasions to do them good, his
delight in the mystery of Christ, his heavenly temper!
These, these are the secrets of the wonderful impression he
made in India, joined as they were with first-rate talents,
fine scholarship, habit of acquiring languages, quickness
and promptitude of perception, and loftiness of imaginative
powers.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s <i>Journal</i> holds a place of its own in the
literature of mysticism. It stamps him as the mystic
writer and worker of the first quarter of the century of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
modern missions (1792-1814), as his master, Robert
Leighton, was of the more barren period that ended in
1688. The too little known <i>Rules and Instructions for
Devout Exercises</i>, found among Leighton&rsquo;s papers, written
with his own hand and for his own use, was Martyn&rsquo;s
&lsquo;usual&rsquo; companion, with results which made that work<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
as supplemented by the <i>Journal</i>, what the <i>De Imitatione
Christi</i> and the <i>Theologia Germanica</i> were to the more
passive dark ages of Christendom. At the close of the
eighteenth century the young and impulsive Cornish student
found himself in an age not less, to him, godless and anti-evangelical
than that which had wrung from the heart of
at least one good man the hopeless longing of the <i>Theologia
Germanica</i>. He had seen his Divine Master crucified
afresh in the person of Charles Simeon, whom he possibly,
as Sargent certainly, had at first attended only to scoff and
brawl. He had been denied a church in which to preach the
goodness of God, in his own county, other than that of a
kinsman. In the troopship and the Bengal barrack
even his official authority could hardly win a hearing from
officer or soldier. The young prophet waxed sore in heart,
as the fire burned within him, at the unbelief and iniquity
of his day, till his naturally sunny spirit scorched the souls
he sought to warm with the Divine persuasiveness. He
stood really at the opening of the Evangelical revival of
Christendom, and like William Carey, who loved the youth,
he was working out his own side of that movement, but,
equally like Carey, he knew it not. He was to do as much
by his death as by his life, but all he knew in his humility
was that he must make haste while he lived to give the
millions of Mohammedans the Word, and to reveal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
them the Person of Jesus Christ. The multitude of his
thoughts within him he committed to a <i>Journal</i>, written
for himself alone, and rescued from burning only by the
interference of his friend Corrie.</p>

<p>The mysticism of Martyn has been pronounced morbid.
All the more that his searching introspection and severe
judgment on himself are a contrast to the genial and merry
conversation of the man who loved music and children&rsquo;s
play, the converse of friends and the conflict of controversy
for the Lord, does every reader who knows his own heart
value the vivisection. Martyn writes of sin and human
nature as they are, and therefore he is clear and comforting
in the answer he gives as to the remedy for the one and
the permanent elevation of the other. Even more than
Leighton he is the Evangelical saint, for where Leighton&rsquo;s
times paralysed him for service, Martyn&rsquo;s called him to
energise and die in the conflict with the greatest apostacy
of the world. Both had a passion to win souls to the entrancing,
transforming love they had found, but unless on the
side against the Stewarts, how could that passion bear fruit
in action? Both, like the author of the <i>De Imitatione</i>, wrote
steeped in the spirit of sadness; but the joy of the dawn of
the modern era of benevolence, as it was even then called,
working unconsciously on the sunny Cornubian spirit,
kept Martyn free alike from the selfish absorption which
marked the monk of the Middle Ages, and the peace-loving
compromise which neutralised Leighton. The one adored
in his cell, the other wrestled in his study at Newbattle or
Dunblane, and we love their writings. But Henry Martyn
worked for his generation and all future ages as well as
wrote, so that they who delight in his mystic communings
are constrained to follow him in his self-sacrificing service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
Beginning at March 1807, let us add some passages from
the <i>Journal</i> to those which have been already extracted for
autobiographical purposes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am thus taught to see what would become of me if
God should let go His strong hand. Is there any depth
into which Satan would not plunge me? Already I know
enough of the nature of Satan&rsquo;s cause to vow before God
eternal enmity to it. Yes! in the name of Christ I say,
&lsquo;Get thee behind me, Satan!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Employed a great deal about one Hebrew text to little
purpose. Much tried with temptation to vanity, but the
Lord giveth me the victory through His mercy from day
to day, or else I know not how I should keep out of hell.</p>

<p>May the Lord, in mercy to my soul, save me from
setting up an idol of any sort in His room, as I do by
preferring a work professedly for Him to communion with
Him. How obstinate the reluctance of the natural heart
to God. But, O my soul, be not deceived, the chief work
on earth is to obtain sanctification, and to walk with God.</p>

<p>O great and gracious God, what should I do without
Thee? but now Thou art manifesting Thyself as the God
of all consolation to my soul. Never was I so near Thee;
I stand on the brink, and I long to take my flight! Oh,
there is not a thing in the world for which I would wish to
live, except because it may please God to appoint me
some work. And how shall my soul ever be thankful
enough to Thee, O Thou most incomprehensibly glorious
Saviour Jesus!</p>

<p>I walk according to my carnal wisdom, striving to
excite seriousness by natural considerations, such as the
thoughts of death and judgment, instead of bringing my
soul to Christ to be sanctified by his spirit.</p>

<p>Preached on Luke xii. 20&mdash;&lsquo;This night thy soul,&rsquo; etc.
The congregation was large, and more attentive than they
have ever yet been. Some of the young officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
soldiers seemed to be in deep concern. I was willing to
believe that the power of God was present, if a wretch so
poor and miserable can be the instrument of good to souls.
Four years have I been in the ministry, and I am not sure
that I have been the means of converting four souls from
the error of their ways. Why is this? The fault must be
in myself. Prayer and secret duties seem to be where I
fail; had I more power in intercession, more self-denial in
persevering in prayer, it would be no doubt better for my
hearers.</p>

<p>My heart sometimes shrinks from spiritual work, and
especially at an increase of ministerial business; but now
I hope, through grace, just at this time, that I can say I
desire no carnal pleasure, no ease to the flesh, but that the
whole of life should be filled up with holy employments
and holy thoughts.</p>

<p>My heart at various times filled with a sense of Divine
love, frequently in prayer was blessed in the bringing of
my soul near to God. After dinner in my walk found
sweet devotion; and the ruling thoughts were, that true
happiness does not consist in the gratifying of self in ease
or individual pleasure, but in conformity to God, in obeying
and pleasing Him, in having no will of my own, in not
being pleased with personal advantages, though I might
be without guilt, nor in being displeased that the flesh is
mortified. Oh, how short-lived will this triumph be! It
is stretching out the arm at full length, which soon grows
tired with its own weight.</p>

<p>I travel up hill, but I must learn, as I trust I am learning,
to do the will of God without any expectation of any
present pleasure attending it, but because it is the will of
God. Oh, that my days of vanity were at an end, and
that all my thoughts and conversation might have that
deep tinge of seriousness which becomes a soldier of the
cross.</p>

<p>To the women preached on the parable of the ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
pieces of silver, and at night to the soldiers on Rev. i. 18.
Afterwards in secret prayer drew near to the Lord. Alas!
how my soul contracts a strangeness with Him; but this
was a restoring season. I felt an indignation against all
impure and sinful thoughts, and a solemn serenity of frame.
Interceded for dear friends in England; this brought my
late dear sister with pain to my recollection, but I felt
relieved by resolving every event, with all its circumstances,
into the will of God.</p>

<p>Read an account of Turkey. The bad effects of the
book were so great that I found instant need of prayer,
and I do not know when I have had such divine and animating
feelings. Oh, it is Thy Spirit that makes me pant
for the skies. It is He that shall make me trample the
world and my lusts beneath my feet, and urge my onward
course towards the crown of life.</p>

<p>Spent the day in reading and prayer, and found comfort
particularly in intercession for friends, but my heart was
pained with many a fear about my own soul. I felt the
duty of praying for the conversion of these poor heathens,
and yet no encouragement to it. How much was there of
imagination before, or rather, how much of unbelief now;
seeing no means ready now, no Word of God to put into
their hands, no preachers, it sometimes seems to me idle to
pray. Alas! wicked heart of unbelief, cannot God create
means, or work without them? But I am weary of myself
and my own sinfulness, and appear exceedingly odious
even to myself, how much more to a holy God. Lord,
pity and save; vile and contemptible is Thy sinful creature,
even as a beast before Thee; help me to awake.</p>

<p>Some letters I received from Calcutta agitated my
silly mind, because my magnificent self seemed likely to
become more conspicuous. O wretched creature, where is
thy place but the dust? it is good for men to trample upon
thee. Various were my reveries on the events apparently
approaching, and self was the prominent character in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
transaction. I am yet a long way from real humility; oh,
when shall I be dead to the world, and desire to be nothing
and nobody, as I now do to be somebody?</p>

<p>Throughout the 18th enjoyed a solemn sense of Divine
things. The promise was fulfilled, &lsquo;Sin shall not have
dominion over you.&rsquo; No enemy seemed permitted to
approach. I sometimes saw naught in the creation but
the works of God, and wondered that mean earthly concerns
had ever drawn away my mind from contemplating
their glorious Author. Oh, that I could be always so, seeing
none but Thee, taught the secrets of Thy covenant,
advancing in knowledge of Thee, growing in likeness to
Thee. How much should I learn of God&rsquo;s glory, were I
an attentive observer of His Word and Providence. How
much should I be taught of His purposes concerning His
Church, did I keep my heart more pure for Him. And
what gifts might I not expect to receive for her benefit,
were I duly earnest to improve His grace for my own! Oh,
how is a life wasted that is not spent with God and employed
for God. What am I doing the greater part of my
time; where is my heart?</p>

<p>Sabat lives almost without prayer, and this is sufficient
to account for all evils that appear in saint or sinner.</p>

<p>I feel disposed to partake of the melancholy with which
such persons (Lady Mary Wortley Montagu) close their
lives. Oh, what hath grace done for us! The thought
sometimes bursts upon me in a way which I cannot describe.
It is not future bliss, but present peace, which we
have actually obtained, and which we cannot be mistaken
in; the very thing which the world seeks for in vain; and
yet how have we found it? By the grace of God we are
what we are.</p>

<p>Truly love is better than knowledge. Much as I long
to know what I seek after, I would rather have the smallest
portion of humility and love than the knowledge of an
archangel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>

<p>At night I spoke to them on &lsquo;Enoch walked with God.&rsquo;
My soul breathed after the same holy, happy state. Oh that
the influence were more abiding; but I am the man that
seeth his natural face in a glass.</p>

<p>This last short sickness has, I trust, been blessed much
to me. I sought not immediately for consolations, but for
grace patiently to endure and to glory in tribulation; in
this way I found peace. Oh, this surely is bliss, to have
our will absorbed in the Divine Will. In this state are the
spirits of just men made perfect in heaven. The spread of
the Gospel in these parts is now become an interesting
subject to you&mdash;such is the universal change.</p>

<p>Perpetually assaulted with temptations, my hope and
trust is that I shall yet be sanctified in the name of the
Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of my God. &lsquo;Purge me with
hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow.&rsquo; When I really strive after purity of
heart&mdash;for my endeavours are too often little more than
pretence&mdash;I find no consideration so effectual as that of the
exalted dignity and infinitely precious privileges of the
saints. Thus a few verses of 1 Eph. are more influential,
purifying, and transforming than the most laboured reasoning.
Indeed, there is no reasoning with such temptations,
and no safety but in flight.</p>

<p>I would that all should adore, but especially that I
myself should lie prostrate. As for self, contemptible self,
I feel myself saying, Let it be forgotten for ever; henceforth
let Christ live, let Christ reign, let Him be glorified for
ever.</p></div>

<p>Henry Martyn, by service, escaped the weakness and
the danger of the mystic who seeks absorption into God,
in the mental sense, as the remedy for sin, instead of a free
and purified individuality in Christ. He felt that the will
sins; he saw the cure to lie not in the destruction of the will,
but in its rectification and personal co-working with God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
Absorption is spiritual suicide, not service. Martyn realised
and taught that a free individuality is the best offering we
can make to God after Christ has given it to us to offer to
Him. With Martyn moral service helped spiritual contemplation
to rise heavenward, and to raise men with it. The
saint was also the sacred scholar and translator; the mystic
was the prophet preacher, the Persian controversialist, the
unresting missionary. His Christian life was guided by
the motto, &lsquo;To believe, to suffer, and to hope.&rsquo; His praying
realised his own ideal of &lsquo;a visit to the invisible world.&rsquo;
His working was ever quickened like St. Paul&rsquo;s by the
summons, alike of the Old dispensation and the New,
which he cut with a diamond on the window of his
college rooms Ἕγειραι, ὁ καθεύδων, καὶ ἀνάστα, &lsquo;Awake
thou that sleepest and arise.&rsquo; When the fierce flame of
his love and his service had burned out his frail body, his
picture, painted at Calcutta the year before he died, spoke
thus to Charles Simeon, and ever since it has whispered to
every new generation of Cambridge men, &lsquo;Be serious, be
in earnest; don&rsquo;t trifle&mdash;don&rsquo;t trifle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The men whom Henry Martyn&rsquo;s pioneering and early
death have led to live and to die that Christ may be revealed
to the Mohammedans, are not so many as the
thousands who have been spiritually stimulated by his
<i>Journal</i>. Such work is still &lsquo;the forlorn hope&rsquo; of the
Church which he was the first to lead. But in Persia and
Arabia he has had such followers as Anthony Groves,
John Wilson, George Maxwell Gordon, Ion Keith-Falconer,
and Bishop French. Where he pointed the way the great
missionary societies of the United States of America and
of England and the Free Church of Scotland have sent
their noblest men and women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>The death of Henry Martyn, followed not many years
after by that of her husband, who had been the first to
mark his grave with a memorial stone, led Mrs. James
Claudius Rich, eldest daughter of Sir James Mackintosh,
to appeal in 1831 for &lsquo;contributions in aid of the school at
Baghdad, and those hoped to be established in Persia and
other parts of the territory of Baghdad.&rsquo; In the same year,
1829, that Alexander Duff sailed for Calcutta, there had
gone forth by the Scots Mission at Astrakhan to Baghdad,
that Catholic founder of the sect since known as &lsquo;The
Brethren,&rsquo; Anthony N. Groves, dentist, of Exeter. Taking
the commands of Christ literally, in the spirit of Henry
Martyn, he sold all he had, and became the first of Martyn&rsquo;s
successors in Persia. The record of his two attempts forms
a romantic chapter in the history of Christian missions.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
All theories apart, he lived and he worked for the Mohammedans
of Persia in the spirit of Henry Martyn. When the
plague first, and persecution the second time, extinguished
this Mission to Baghdad, Dr. John Wilson,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> from his central
and commanding position in Bombay, flashed into Arabia
and Persia such rays of Gospel light as were possible at
that time. He sent Bible colporteurs by Aden and up the
Persian Gulf; he summoned the old Church of Scotland
to despatch a mission to the Jews of Arabia, Busrah, and
Bombay. A missionary was ready in the person of
William Burns who afterwards went to China, the support
of a missionary at Aden was guaranteed by a friend, and
Wilson had found a volunteer &lsquo;for the purpose of exploring
Arabia,&rsquo; when the disruption of the Church of Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
arrested the movement, only, however, vastly to increase
the missionary development in India and Africa, as well
as church extension in Scotland. What John Wilson tried
in vain to do during his life was effected by his death. It
was his career that summoned the Hon. Ion Keith-Falconer
and his wife to open their Mission in Yemen, at Sheikh
Othman and Aden. Like Martyn at Tokat, in the far
north, and just at Martyn&rsquo;s age, by his dust in the Aden
cemetery Ion Keith-Falconer has taken possession of
Arabia for Christ. &lsquo;The <i>Memoirs of David Brainerd</i> and
<i>Henry Martyn</i> gave me particular pleasure,&rsquo; wrote young
John Wilson in 1824. &lsquo;Mind to get hold of the <i>Life of
John Wilson</i>, the great Scotch missionary of India,&rsquo; wrote
the young Ion Keith-Falconer in 1878.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> So the apostolic
succession goes on.</p>

<p>Gordon of Kandahar, &lsquo;the pilgrim missionary of the
Punjab,&rsquo; was not the least remarkable of Henry Martyn&rsquo;s
deliberate followers, alike in a life of toil and in a death of
heroism for the Master. Born in 1839, he was of Trinity
College, Cambridge, and had as his fellow-curate Thomas
Valpy French, when the future bishop came back from
his first missionary campaign in India. Dedicating himself,
his culture, and his considerable property to the Lord, he
placed his unpaid services at the disposal of the Church
Missionary Society, as Martyn once did. Refusing a
bishopric after his first furlough, and seeking to prepare
himself for the work of French&rsquo;s Divinity School of St.
John at Lahore, he returned to India by Persia, to learn
the language and to help Dr. Bruce for a little in 1871.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
The famine was sore in that land, and he lived for its
people as &lsquo;relieving officer, doctor, purveyor, poorhouse
guardian, outfitter and undertaker. There is a cry like the
cry of Egypt in the night of the Exodus&mdash;not a house in
which there was not one dead.&rsquo; So he wrote.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> From
Julfa he carried relief to Shiraz, where he found himself in
the midst of the associations made sacred by Henry
Martyn&rsquo;s residence there. &lsquo;I have taken up my quarters
in a Persian&rsquo;s house, and have a large garden all to myself.
I am in the very same house which Henry Martyn was in.
I heard to-day that my host is the grandson of his host
Jaffir Ali Khan, and that the house has come down from
father to son.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Eight years after Gordon was in Kandahar, sole
(honorary) chaplain to the twenty regiments who were
fighting the Ameer of Afghanistan. There he found the
assistant to the political officer attached to the force to be
the same Persian gentleman who had been his host at
Shiraz, and with whom when a child Martyn must have
played. Gordon learned from him that the roads and
sanitary improvements made as relief works, as well as the
orphanage started on the interest of the famine relief fund
sent from London, were still blessing the people. When,
after the black day of Maiwand, the British troops were
besieged in Kandahar, till relieved by the march and the
triumph of Lord Roberts, Gordon as chaplain attended a
sortie to dislodge the enemy. Hearing that wounded men
were lying in a shrine outside the Kabul gate, he led out
some bearers with a litter, and found that the dying men
were in another shrine still more distant. In spite of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
remonstrance he dashed through the murderous fire of the
enemy, was struck down, and was himself carried back
on the litter he had provided for others. He did not live
to wear the Victoria Cross, but was on the same day,
August 16, laid in a soldier&rsquo;s grave.</p>

<p>It would seem difficult to name a follower more worthy
of Henry Martyn than that, but Bishop French was such
a disciple. More than any man, as saint and scholar, as
missionary and chaplain, as the friend of the Mohammedan
and the second apostle of Central Asia, he was baptized
for the dead. Born on the first day of 1825, son of an
Evangelical clergyman in Burton-on-Trent, a Rugby boy,
and Fellow and Tutor of University College, Oxford,
Thomas Valpy French was early inspired by Martyn&rsquo;s life
and writings. These and his mother&rsquo;s holiness sent him
forth to Agra in 1850, along with Edward Stuart of
Edinburgh, now Bishop of Waiapu, New Zealand, to found
the Church Missionary College there. In the next forty
years, till he resigned the bishopric of Lahore that he
might give the rest of his life to work out the aspirations
of Martyn in Persia and Arabia, he consecrated himself and
his all to Christ. It will be a wonderful story if it is well
told. He then went home for rest, first of all, but took the
way north through Persia and Turkey on Martyn&rsquo;s track,
so that in April 1888 he wrote from Armenia: &lsquo;Were I
ignorant both of Arabic and French, I should subside into
the perfect rest, perhaps, which I require.&rsquo; So abundant
were his labours to groups of Mohammedans and among
the Syrian Christians, that he had nearly found a grave in
the Tokat region.</p>

<p>After counselling the Archbishop of Canterbury as to
the project of so reforming the Oriental Churches as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
convert them themselves into the true apostles of the
Mohammedan race, Bishop French returned to Asia and
settled near Muscat, whence he wrote thus on March 10,
1891, his last letter to the Church Missionary Society:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those three years of Arab study will not, I trust, be
thrown away and proved futile. In memory of H. Martyn&rsquo;s
pleadings for Arabia, Arabs, and the Arabic, I seem almost
trying at least to follow more directly in his footsteps and
under his guidance, than even in Persia or India, however
incalculable the distance at which the guided one follows
the leader!...</p>

<p>I have scarcely expressed in the least degree the view
I have of the <i>extremely serious</i> character of the work here
to be entered upon; and the possible&mdash;nay probable&mdash;severity
of the conflict to be expected and faithfully
hazarded by the Church of Christ between two such strong
and ancient forces, pledged to such hereditary and deep-grounded
hostility. Yet <i>The Lamb shall overcome them;
for He is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; and they
also shall overcome that are with Him, called and chosen and
faithful</i>.</p></div>

<p>Two months after, on May 14, 1891, at the age of
sixty-six, after exposure and toils like Martyn&rsquo;s, he was
laid to rest in the cemetery of Muscat by the sailors of
H.M.S. Sphinx, to whom he had preached.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn at Tokat, John Wilson at Bombay,
George Maxwell Gordon at Kandahar, Ion Keith-Falconer
at Aden, and Thomas Valpy French at Muscat, have by
their bodies taken possession of Mohammedan Asia for
Christ till the resurrection. Of each we say to ourselves
and to our generation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Is it for nothing he is dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Send forth your children in his stead!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
<span class="i10">O Eastern lover from the West!<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Thou hast out-soared these prisoning bars;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Thy memory, on thy Master&rsquo;s breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Uplifts us like the beckoning stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">We follow now as thou hast led,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Baptize us, Saviour, for the dead.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Each, like not a few American missionaries, men and
women, like Dr. Bruce and his colleagues of the Church
Missionary Society, like Mr. W.W. Gardner and Dr. J.C.
Young of the Scottish Keith-Falconer Mission, is a representative
of the two great principles, as expressed by
Dr. Bruce: (1) That the lands under the rule of Islam belong
to Christ, and that it is the bounden duty of the Church to
claim them for our Lord. (2) That duty can be performed
only by men who are willing to die in carrying it out.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn&rsquo;s words, almost his last, on his thirty-first
birthday were these: &lsquo;The Word of God has found
its way into this land of Satan (Persia), and the devil will
never be able to resist it if the Lord hath sent it.&rsquo; We
have seen what sort of men the Lord raised up to follow
him. This is what the Societies have done. In 1829 the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions
began, and in 1871 the Presbyterian Board shared, the
mission to Persia and Asiatic Turkey. The former has
missionaries at Aintab, Marash, Antioch, Aleppo, and Oorfa,
to the south of the Taurus range, being its mission to Central
Turkey; at Constantinople, Adrianople, Smyrna, Broosa,
Nicomedia, Trebizond, Marsovan, Sivas, <i>including Tokat</i>,
and Cæsarea, being its mission to Western Turkey; at
Erzroom, Harpoot, and Arabkir, uniting with the Assyrian
stations of Mardin and Diarbekir, its mission to Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
Turkey. Taking up the evangelisation at Oroomiah, the
American Presbyterians unite with that Tabreez, Mosul,
and Salmas as their Western, and Teheran and Hamadan
as their Eastern Persia Mission. In 1876 a letter of Henry
Venn&rsquo;s and the urgency of its principal missionary, Dr.
Bruce, led the Church Missionary Society to charge itself
with the evangelisation, by a revised version of the Persian
Bible and medical missions, of the whole southern half of
the ancient kingdom of Persia, the whole of Nimrod&rsquo;s
Babylonia, and the eastern coast of Arabia, from Julfa
(Ispahan) and Baghdad as centres. Very recently the
independent Arabian Mission of America has made Busrah
its headquarters for Turkish Arabia. The Latin Church
since 1838 has worked for the Papacy alone. The Archbishop
of Canterbury&rsquo;s mission since 1886 has sought to
influence the Nestorian or Syrian Church, which in the
seventh century sent forth missionaries to India from
Seleucia, Nisibis, and Edessa, and now desires protection
from Romish usurpation. All these represent a vast and
geographically linked organisation claiming, at long intervals,
the whole of Turkey, Persia, and Arabia for Christ
since Henry Martyn pointed the way. Dr. Robert Bruce,
writing to us from Julfa, thus sums up the results and the
prospect:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I believe there is a great work going on at present in
Persia, and Henry Martyn and his translations prepared
the way for it, to say nothing of his life sacrifice and prayers
for this dark land. The Babi movement is a very remarkable
one, and is spreading far and wide, and doing much
to break the power of the priesthood. Many of the Babis
are finding their system unsatisfactory, and beginning to
see that it is only a half-way house (in which there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
rest or salvation) to Christianity. Ispahan has been kept
this year in a constant state of turmoil by the ineffectual
efforts of two moollas to persecute both Babis and Jews.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
They have caused very great suffering to some of both these
faiths, but they have been really defeated, and all these
persecutions have tended towards religious liberty. Our
mission-house is the refuge of all such persecuted ones, and
the light is beginning to dawn upon them.</p></div>

<p>While the whole Church, and every meditative soul
seeking deliverance from self in Jesus Christ, claims Henry
Martyn, he is specially the hero of the Church of England.
An Evangelical, he is canonised, so far as ecclesiastical art
can legitimately do that, in the baptistry of the new
cathedral of his native city. A Catholic, his memory is
enshrined in the heart of his own University of Cambridge.
There, in the New Chapel of St. John&rsquo;s College, in the
nineteenth bay of its interior roof, his figure is painted first
of the <i>illustriories</i> of the eighteenth Christian century, before
those of Wilberforce, Wordsworth, and Thomas Whytehead,
missionary to New Zealand. In the market place, beside
Charles Simeon&rsquo;s church, there was dedicated on October 18,
1887, &lsquo;The Henry Martyn Memorial Hall.&rsquo; There, under
the shadow of his name, gather daily the students who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
join in the University Prayer Meeting, and from time to
time the members of the Church Missionary and Gospel
Propagation Societies. &lsquo;This was the hero-life of my
boyhood,&rsquo; said Dr. Vaughan, the Master of the Temple
and Dean of Llandaff, when he preached the opening
sermon before the University. In Trinity Church, where
Martyn had been curate, the new Master of Trinity
preached so that men said: &lsquo;What a power of saintliness
must have been in Henry Martyn to have affected with
such appreciative love one whose own life and character
are so honoured as Dr. Butler&rsquo;s!&rsquo; In the Memorial Hall
itself, its founder, Mr. Barton, now Vicar of Trinity Church;
Dr., now Bishop, Westcott, for the faculty of Divinity;
Dr. Bailey, for St. John&rsquo;s College and the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel; Mr. Barlow, Vicar of Islington,
for the Church Missionary Society; and the Christian
scholar, Professor Cowell, for all Orientalists and Anglo-Indians,
spake worthily.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We would continue his work. The hopes, the faith,
the truths which once animated him are still ours. Still,
as on the day when he preached his first sermon from this
pulpit, is it true that if each soul, if each society, if each
heathen nation knew the gift of God, and Who the
promised Saviour is, they would for very thirst&rsquo;s sake ask
of Him, and He would indeed give them His living water.
And still it is the task of each true witness of Christ, and
most of all of each ordained minister of His Word and
Sacraments, first to arouse that thirst where it has not yet
been felt, and then to allay it at once and perpetuate it
from the one pure and undefiled spring. And still each
true minister will feel, as Martyn felt, as St. Paul himself
felt, &lsquo;Who is sufficient for these things?&rsquo; The riper he is
in his ministry, the more delicate his touch of human souls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
alike in their strivings and in their inertness; the closer
his walk with God and his wonder at the vastness and the
silent secrecy of God&rsquo;s ways, the more he will say in his
heart what Martyn said but a few days after his feet had
ceased to tread our Cambridge streets. &lsquo;Alas! do I think
that a schoolboy or a raw academic should be likely to
lead the hearts of men! What a knowledge of men and
acquaintance with Scriptures, what communion with God
and study of my own heart, ought to prepare me for the
awful work of a messenger from God on the business of the
soul!&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>To these lessons of Martyn&rsquo;s life Dr. Butler added
that which the eighty years since have suggested&mdash;the
confidence of the soldier who has heard his Captain&rsquo;s voice,
and knows that it was never deceived or deceiving: <i>Be
of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</i></p>

<p>In that confidence let the Church Catholic preach
Christ to the hundred and eighty millions of the Mohammedan
peoples, more than half of whom are already the
subjects of Christian rulers. Thus shall every true Christian
best honour Henry Martyn.</p>

will one day soften these hearts still more, and teach them the secret of
which their poets have sung in such ardent strains. A Sufi has already learnt
that Islam cannot satisfy the longing soul. He is, by profession, tolerant or
even sympathetic in the presence of the Cross. And he believes, like all
Moslim, that Isa, the Messiah of Israel, has the breath of life, and can raise
the dead from the tomb.... To the reflecting mind, however, the lyric
effusions of Hafiz prove that Eastern philosophy is either childlike or retrograde,
and its principles at the mercy of those seas of passion upon which it
has so long been drifting.&rsquo; <i>Quarterly Review</i>, January 1892.</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
